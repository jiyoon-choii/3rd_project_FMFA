Don't skip the fried potstickers - DH said they tasted like the ones in Seoul. He had the bibimbop and said it was delicious. As others mentioned, the place is small with kitchy decor. Service and food quality were 100% and top notch. I'm all in on the Korea House! We'll be back!\n",

I have zero experience with Korean food, but I found everything tasty. The side dishes are fun. Prices are moderate and parking plentiful. This is a very casual place. They do take credit cards.\n",

If you have an affinity for korean food, I recommend Korea House.\n",

Portions were very appropriate for someone with a large appetite. Rice was sticky and moist without being mushy. There was a bit of wait as it was very crowded; but, I would say it's worth the wait.

They bring out a lot of sides (\"banchan\") to the table for everyone to share, good variety of dishes like kimchi, bean sprouts, potatoes, etc. Staff is always welcoming and friendly. All those awards are well earned.\n",

      "17 Hands down, the most authentic Korean experience I've had back in the states, the food is delicious, and prepared by what appears to be a family. Make sure to eat your fill while you're there because Korean food has the tendency to make itself known in the fridge. I've seen some complaints about service, but they operate just like restaurants in Korea do, you've got to tell them you want something, and it'll be on the table in no time flat. The only downside is that I didn't have the stomach to eat everything on the menu, they basically have all of the classics that you could possibly want. If I lived closer, this would be a weekly spot.\n",

      "18 My wife and I both enjoy Korean food very much but it is very difficult to find in many cities in the South. This restaurant was rated as the best Korean food in the Nashville area so we tried it. I had the KimChee soup with beef and Mary had Bulgogi. We were served the traditional little side dishes with our meal and these are always my way of separating the good from the very best. The kim chee itself was on the rather tame side. I did not request the really dilish hot stuff and am sorry I did not. However, it was very good and the soup was outstanding to the last drop and it was served in a huge bowl which I lifted and drained just like I used to do in Korea! The bulgogi was also very good. The service was friendly and helpful and relatively fast and the prices were reasonable. If you want to try Korean food, this is a very good place to do it with good food and a large selection to choose from. I cannot remember the name of the red \"paste\" they always bring in a side dish which looks like ketchup but I can say that it is what stole the show for me here! I dipped everything I could in it and it was SCRUMPTIOUS!\n",

      "22 Decided to have my last lunch of 2016 at Korea House. I know there's a Chinese New Year, but is there. Korean new year? The iPhone didn't capitalize Korean new year, but did for Chinese New Year, so I guess not. Anyway, back to Korea House. Located in a strip mall along Charlotte Pike, it's a rather small and unassuming restaurant. We had a party of six and were at immediately, but we also arrived at open. I can see where this place would fill up rather quickly because of the small size.\n",

      "As my first time here, and I think my first time at a Korean place, I skimmed the pictures on here and got a couple tips from some friends who'd ate here before. I went with the chicken bulgogi ($14.99). I wasn't sure what it was, but the bulgogi seemed like the popular thing on the menu. It came with a bunch of different sides. We had a table of 6, and they brought out two ordered of sides for the table. The portion for the chicken bulgogi was large, it also came with a container of steamed, white rice. I mixed some of the rice in with the main dish and put a little of the sauce from the bottle onto my plate. It was a little spicy, but not insanely spicy. I enjoyed it and would probably get it again if I went back.\n",

      "40 Those of us in the Nashville advertising community are a fairly tight knit bunch. Joe and I made a date for lunch and he suggested Korea House on Charlotte. \"Sure thing\" was my reply. When I arrived on the scene Joe was seated and I told him as I sat down that it was my first time, not only at Korea House, but also to try Korean food. His immediate response was that he assumed I'd been there with his cousin, Judy, also an advertising vet and dear buddy of mine. The place was shabby chic. Populated by diners who were largely seemingly Korean. A Korean TV station was on the screens. Followed Joe's lead and ordered the #16. Dolsot Bibimbap - rice topped with vegetables and beef bits and a fried egg in a hot stone pot. When our dishes arrived on he table they were literally sizzling. The waitress with a beautiful smile had brought us small dishes of assorted additions to mix into our stone pots. We mixed and blended. The results were a delicious cacophony of flavors. Have to confess, upon entry I was a bit worried. Glad I followed Joe's lead with #16. Just really great! Going back for sure. Thanks, Joe for introducing me to Korea House! Totally enjoyed! A new Nashville favorite!\n",

Yummy beef, veggies, rice served in a hot iron pot topped w/egg.

The food was delicious and hot (both temperature and spice) and you get a lot of it. Some lunch items were served in a steaming stone pot that kept the food cooking throughout the entire meal. The menu is authentic Korean cuisine with nearly 100 options to choose from. However, it’s not somewhere to go if you are looking for a quick business lunch. Lunch lasted about 90 minutes. It’s also not good for large groups (go with a group of 4 or less).\n",

      "46 We have been to Korea House a few times. The food is consistently good and is pretty cheap overall. I order the bimbimbap with beef, which comes with all the classic Korean side accompaniments. It comes out served in a hot stone or clay pot so that the bottom of the rice gets extremely crispy- which makes it absolutely delicious. Another staple we normally get is the beef ribs - they come with scallions and a wonderful sauce on a hot plate. I absolutely love their house made hot sauce - it is like a Korean style Sirachai- sooo good. The only things we haven't been huge fans of were the seafood pancake and the tripe soup. The seafood pancake was almost inedible because it was so fishy tasting. Even with having a few dishes we would never order again, the food is consistently pretty good. Service is ok- its not fine dining or even like a regular restaurant. The set up is a little cramped style but is normally full because its probably the best Korean in Nashville.\n",

Folks standing in line outside should have been our first clue. The service was slow, but the food was oh-so-wonderful. Like beef bulgogi? Bibimbap? Eight sides to share? Fresh ingredients served hot, authentic flavors. Dynamite experience and would like to sample other menu items soon.\n",

It was our first time at a Korean restaurant so when we would try to ask questions they were short with us or would just walk away. When the woman brought the sides out we asked what they were and the woman as she was walking away said \"sides\". We knew that, we wanted to know what each one was. So when she walked back by I stopped her and asked what was in each one and she just did not want to tell us. I finally just asked if any had fish since I don't like fish and was told one did. But I would still go back because the food is that good!\n",

      "50 My husband and I love Korean food so we are always on the lookout for a good, authentic Korean restaurant. Because we travel to Nashville several times a year we asked around and were directed to Korea House. The first thing I noticed when walking into the small restaurant was the amount of Korean people having dinner. Good sign if you are looking for authentic Korean food! Second thing I noticed was how well worn everything was (in a nice homey way), another good sign to me. We ordered bulgogi (one chicken, one beef) and dolsot bibimbap. The food is amazingly good, so flavorful and spicy! The sides were great, I especially love the kimchi and the bean sprouts. Our server mixed the bibimbap for us and it was perfect. We will continue to frequent Korea House whenever we are in Nashville as the food is great. ***On a side note, the first time we visited the server we had (a young woman) was not very nice, she was almost hostile for some reason. We ordered three meals so we could share a little of each and take the rest back with us to eat over the next couple of days (unless my teen son gets hungry...then it is one meal). She had the nerve to look at us and say \"That's a lot of food...\" and just stood there. So what? We were paying for it so why the concern? The second time our server was an older woman and she was awesome! Couldn't have asked for a better sever. She sealed the deal for us as we had planned to look elsewhere if the service had been as poor as it had been the first time. She brought us boxes for our leftover food and didn't bat an eye when we ordered three meals :)\n",

I called ahead since I was running behind and they said be there by 9:30 and it would be okay. I arrived at 9:20 and the owner still turned me away. The previous time I waited in line til 9:30 but was turned away even though I arrived at 9:00. I will NOT be back again. From now on I will go to hai woon dai where the food is just slightly less quality than that at Korea house IMO. But the hospitality at hai woon dai is worlds better.

I've had bad Korean food, and am not universally accepting of the genre. This is not bad Korean food. This is seriously delicious Korean food. The ban chan are like little gems set in front of you to sample and enhance your meal, and they make their own kimchi too. It's perfect on the hot-sour meter as far as I'm concerned. The only thing this place does not have (which I wouldn't expect them to) that I miss are soju cocktails. If you've had soju cocktails with the easy pour spout and the deceptively tiny glasses, you know what I mean. Otherwise love these welcoming, happy people and the food they make!!!\n",

Bulgogi was tender and juicy beef barbecue cooked with onions and scallions and eaten with white rice. The bibimbop is a dish with pickled carrots, radishes, lettuce, barbecue beef, egg, mushrooms, bean sprouts, and a hot and sweet sauce. It was beautiful and delicious. The seafood pancake (pajon) was really good--- thick, aromatic, crispy, with a tangy sauce, and small pieces of shrimp and squid in the pancake. The soondubujige, a seafood stew, was gobbled up by the family. All the dishes are served with small side dishes including kimchee, bean sprouts, tempura, omelettes, radishes, and cucumbers.

You put the meat on a lettuce leaf, add the red sauce, some steamed rice, and shredded radish. YUM! This is the national dish of Korean and it is GREAT! Then we also get Kimchee fried rice - spicy and tasty. And Chop Cha. This is a noodle dish that has meat and veggies. It is lots of food, but you will want to taste it all and if there is any left take it home for later. Everyone that we have taken here loves it! It is in a strip mall.

Also, if I dine in for lunch and get the lunch plate you get 3 sides BUT if get a lunch plate to go, you ONLY get 2 sides and again the portion size is not enough to have for the entire meal. Sides should be the same REGARDLESS to whether I dine in or take out! Also, yesterday (14 MAR 19) I ordered a plate to go and asked how much for a side of reddish and the size (because the last time I got the little plastic condiment size container for my sides, so I wanted to know if I paid for extra what size would it be. I was told the ounce size...IT WAS NO. Waiter tried to compensate by saying he FILLED the container to full for me - well DUH. Why should it not be full? Especially as small as it was - not my ounce for the price! I fully intend to speak to management my next visit. Times are too hard for us to pay for such small portions. We expect and demand better from American style establishments and ALL should be held to the same standard. UNACCEPTABLE.\n",

I had not been there recently so I was unaware if any changes had been made. As I entered the parking lot I noticed that the main business sign still prominently displayed \" Sushi Bar \". I went in and was immediately seated as there were not many customers. I was given a menu and no sushi was on it. I asked a server and was told they did not do sushi anymore. As it was lunch I did not have time to go elsewhere so I ordered a spicy chicken box. The chicken was passable but I've had much better at other Korean or Vietnamese restaurants in town. The accompanying dishes were for the most part not very good. No sauce was served with the stuffed dumpling as you usually see. Service was okay but nothing was making up for the false advertising and mediocre food. You can get much better Korean at a better lunch price at several places in Huntsville. As I left I took another look at the sign to make sure I wasn't crazy. Nope, it still said \" Sushi Bar \"\n",

I had the chicken bibimbop in the stone pot and it was excellent. It came out sizzling hot from the kitchen and the miso soup is some of the best i've had.

When we walked in we were greeted immediately and seated in the \"party section\" in the back. They were very busy so this didn't bother us at all; we were just happy to get a seat that fast. We looked at the menu and our waiter was taking our order in less than 2 minutes. I ordered the Bulgogi Lunch Box and my husband ordered the rice dish with Bulgogi and a fried egg on top (I don't remember exactly what it was called). We received our miso soup and then our little side dishes of kimchi, radish, etc. very quickly. The food was great. The soup was served hot, with the little tofu pieces, and the side dishes were exactly what we expected. When I received my lunch box I was impressed because it looked and smelled amazing. My husband received his food about 3-4 minutes later. Because we didn't receive our food at the same time, we never got a check to go pay (we had to relay what we ordered to the cashier at the front), and also because the women next to us ordered some soup that smelled so bad (like hot blue cheese) that it was VERY hard to continue to eat our lunch without getting sick; I've decided to give them 4 stars instead of 5. The service and food was great so we will return, and I do highly recommend I Love Korea for great food for a great price. Hopefully when we do return no one will order that horrible soup again.

      "140 The restaurant is literally a few meters away from the tram station but is not in plain view so you can easily miss it if you are not paying attention or if you don’t know where to look. The fact there are some stairs very near is also not helping. However after you step in you realize that the inside is quite big and quite nice. The setting is very pleasing and the decor is retaining the Korean motives in clean modern lines. We didn’t know what to expect with respect to the food when we entered in. And we can not certify if is authentic Korean food. What we can say that it tasted very good. The service was also nice, no personal touch but fast and professional. We noticed near by a family with a small baby and they had a high chair. Overall a great find in Prague. We will probably return. P.S. if is a weekend is better to make a reservation.\n",

      "141 We visited this Korean restaurant as per recommendation and noticing that it was very close to our accommodation. We didn’t book in advance as it was only a Thursday evening, but upon arrival we considered ourselves lucky as we managed to get one of the last tables. There was a wide range of dishes on offer, predominantly different variations of bibimbap dishes but many others too. I ordered the Bulgogi Bibimbap (Number 2 on the menu) and my boyfriend ordered the Jeyuk-bokeum-bap (Number 8). Both dishes were served with a side of kimchi and my Bulgogi Bibimbap also came with a clear soup. Both dishes were extremely tasty and my boyfriend even joked about asking for the recipe as it was that good and he wanted us to make it back at home. The service was very prompt and the prices reasonably cheap, we paid around 500kc with a tip from what I can remember. Would highly recommend.\n",

I was impressed with the waitresses, they are kind, respectful & speak English, three characteristics that are hard to find in Prague (sorry to say that, they don't have customer service skills here). I was personally served by a blonde one (I'm sorry, I don't know her name). Despite I ordered something but I meant something else, she immediately went to the kitchen and got me what I wanted, literally in 5 minutes. Thank you so much!\n",

      "218 I/we have visited the place twice in the past month. One was a quick lunch (the place does not offer any special lunch menu) and the other was what was to be a decent birthday celebration. Food is great in terms of its variety, authenticity, and freshness. Other reviews testify to this, show you pics etc so no need to delve in detail on this. The service is, however, problematic. The lunch experience was below average, service-wise, in terms of attentiveness etc but since the place was pretty empty, it was bearable. However, the birthday celebration on Friday night occassion with a place having being completely packed revealed and amplified this general problem. The staff was very nervous as a line of guests waited inside and outside the restaurant demanding to be seated. Afyer being seated, I had to leave the table three times - first to ask for the menu card (after 20 minutes waiting and not seeing anyone to come and say even hello), second to ask where our soup was after another 30 mins of nothing happening after i brought a waiter with me to the table, and, third, the same with our main course somehow not making it to our table, again, after 30mins, with soup balls still on table!!! Next tables were not served any better but the international crowd of youngsters seemed to be patient if dissatisfied too. Additionally, the right side of the restaurant was very cold and we kept our winter jacket on at times. BOTTOM LINE: I Will give it a third chance as we live nearby but if the service is not substantially improved i will go elsewhere then. There is another jap-korean restaurant nearby (wont identify not to be blamed for favouring it) which, albeit more expensive, provides top service.\n"

      "233 Having lived in Korea for over two years, and being with a Korean, we were excited (but a bit skeptical) to find some Korean food next to our place. We went for lunch and ordered Bibimbap, Pajeon, and bulgogi kimbap. The restaurant's signature dish was delicious - on par with what you'd find in Korea! Flavorful, authentic, and chocked-full of various fresh veggies. We also appreciated that it wasn't served too hot. Our pajeon was solid; nice and crispy on the outside and soft inside with delicious bits of green onion and squid. The kimbap, a staple of my diet when I lived in Seoul, was a bit of a letdown. A tad bland and dry, you can see why they didn't name the place \"Kimbap.\" The meal wasn't cheap, but not prohibitively expensive either, though I'm used to paying less for similar dishes. The biggest negative of the meal was the lack of side dishes, as well as bland kimchi that seemed 'washed' in attempt to downplay its natural spiciness for the European market.\n",

We ordered an udong and a kimchi-jigae and they were both amazingly delicious. The banchan was also really nice and the service was also nice. The owner was there and greeted us. Also, the price was absolutely great.\n",

      "284 We spent last 18 months traveling around. We were always looking for Korean bistro to fulfill our desire for our favourite Bibimbap. This actually never happened, because the best and only real Bibimbap for us is the one that Mr. & Mrs. Lee are serving in their restaurant. There is no better Korean restaurant in English and Spanish speaking world! Their recipes for Kimchi and Tuna soup are just perfect. Soup is so strong and tasty, it is a cure for any weakness.\n",

Soup and kimchi comes with the meal. Total price of CZK150,- is cheap for what you get! And really good price point so everyone can afford this experience.\n",

Thanks to Bibimbap Korea I was introduced to Korean food and it was love at first sight :) I am very happy that even though they've moved from near my office, now they are near my home and we go almost every week for dinner. Delicious food, esp. bibimbap and really nice service for a very reasonable price. The average item on the menu costs around 150-160 crowns. I couldn't recommend this restaurant more.\n"

The owner is super sweet and talkative and is clearly very proud of his little establishment.\n",

The best thing we had was the Kimpap (or Gimbap). We have had this many times before and I think this was my favourite one. We also had the Ramyeon which was really good for a cold night and bibimbap in a stone bowl was nice but could do with some more vegetables. It`s very reasonable priced to eat here so order a bottle of Soju and enjoy!\n",

It was really cold cleaning spicy food and I enjoyed it a lot. Yellow tea - I took it without honey/sugar and it was not my favourite kind of tea. It tastes as burnt rice. It wasn't my favourite taste. But I drank it and felt good afterwards. It was a lovely experience to taste the spicy food with refreshing, rather sour salad.\n",

All the food were very mediocre, when we started to think the pork bibimbap was quite good, the rice was piping hot but when we put the pork in the mouth, they were fridge cold, so just ate the rice without the pork. When we mentioned it after paying, the server said, the pork was precooked and stored in the fridge, they forgot to warm it up before putting them on the rice.\n",

For a plate of vegetable dumplings, fried squid that was thin and covered in panko and oily and a plain plate of beef short rib (£15!!!!!) bulgogi without rice or anything, we paid £33 - what the actual help?! The portions were tiny too. We were given tap water in a re-usable pink plastic water bottle you use to take water on your bicycle and then at the end of the meal, 2 slices of orange on a plate. By far the most bizarre and most expensive meal we have had which was not worth even £5 to make. We felt this was some kind of joke. Still can't quite believe it. Both of us a size 10 - we went for food afterwards. Unbelievable.\n",

The portions were generous and the service was excellent. I can see why it is such a favourite. You can have a super meal here at a very reasonable price - especially if you bring your own drinks.\n"

I agree with other reviews, the starters are a bit expensive and the yaki soba was bland and not very nice. My friend wasn't that impressed with his meal choice either. The service was a bit patchy which I can forgive if the food is good but sadly this wasn't the case this visit.

      "351 Went to Dain Korea for a small party. The food was nice and the service very good. They were very accommodating and happy for us to decorate etc. We didn't feel rushed and was a really nice atmosphere. Bring your own alcohol too which is great. Reasonably priced and their hot pots are really nice. I've had better sushi but wasn't bad. My only gripe was that it took them a very long time to clear our table once we'd finished eating. But only a minor thing. Would recommend.\n",

      "352 Highly recommended. This place took me back to my time in South Korea, authentic Korean soul food that I dearly missed. Seeing the chef attend all tables and asking how the food was really blew me away. Something I haven't seen in a long time, great touch definitely felt the love in the cooking. Most of all its veggie friendly, no pork in the broths! Thank you for the great experience and catering for vegetarians. Our new favourite restaurant.\n",

Visiting with friends from London on a Wednesday night, I was a little disappointed to see it was a Korean and Japanese place and was even more disappointed in the menu. There was key Korean and Japanese dishes, but not enough of either.\n",

      "356 Had a staff night there on Thursday 17/03/2016. We were a table of 6 and I can tell that we all felt the same way. The food was really good and fresh. However, service was not that good. We asked for 6 wine glasses (BYOB by the way), and we had to ask them to change three of them as they were really dirty (one of them even had some salad on it!!!). Then, we ordered some starters to share which were all great and 6 main course. As 5 of us had our meals served after 45 minutes wait after we finished the starters (which were not cleared from the table), one of us didn't get his meal. We had to ask the waiter for the 6th meal, which they forgot about. I noticed during the dinner that other tables were not cleared until someone else was arriving... Overall, a descent restaurant with good prices but a poor customer service experience.\n",

The staff is very friendly and would advise on the menu. But the most amazing thing about them is that they do delivery, although not everywhere but if you are in the centre or around you are good. Me and my friends order delivery all the time and it's so useful especially during exam period when everyone is too busy with revision. But you have to order food for more than £20.

It's served in a hot earthenware bowl with boiled rice in the bottom (making it crispy), layered with cooked vegetable, choice of chicken, beef, pork, prawn or tofu (beef recommended and taken), and an egg so the flavours go down into the rice - served with your own bottle of red chilli paste so you can control how hot you want it. I loved it and can't wait to go back. We washed it down with a (375ml) bottle of 18% rice wine, that went well and had a clean slightly vodka-like flavour. With a couple of side dishes and salads, we happily paid £20 each and left feeling full and satisfied. The same menu is served for lunch, mostly at reduced prices - a definite bargain!\n",

      "374 On our last day in Bristol we popped into this restaurant for lunch although it looked pretty empty. The ambience was a bit on the dark side and it didn’t appear very clean with an open kitchen that looked like a corridor. Once we sat down we ordered Mandu which I guess is the Korean version of Gyoza. The flavour wasn’t too bad although I would have left it a bit more in the pan to get the pastry a bit crispier. The Seafood Pancake (which didn’t appear to have much seafood inside) with spring onion wasn’t too bad either although the middle was uncooked and had a gluey consistency. Then came the masterpiece! We orderered 2 katsu curry (Chicken and Pork) from the special lunch menu but we got was 2 cutlets in gloopy sauce that I believe is a different dish and it remainded me of branston pickle! I had the pork and the colour of the meat was almost black and had a funny taste. My fiancé’s chicken was a touch better but again it had a funny taste. We complained and they asked if we wanted something else and because we were famished we asked if we could have 2 portions of Mandu instead which were the best part of our meal but this time they arrived undercooked and one of them was cold in the middle. I don’t have a problem if they were frozen before but at least they could have been cooked properly. It is not that they were too busy either, there was us and another table, so why the rush? We complained again and the waitress then later on the owner pretended that there was a misunderstanding regarding the curry. Well, that wasn’t our problem as we had ordered from the daily special menu and there was only one curry option! Anyway the owner wanted us not to pay the bill but we insisted that we wanted too and at end we paid for the 2 dishes we ate. This has to be one of the most unpleasant meals for sometime!\n",

The staff are great and the lovely waitress who told me she was from Daegu was really friendly. I hope to go back once they are selling alcohol because the only thing that would make this better was if they also sold Makgeolli. As far as the food goes it was all exceptional. The bulgogi is as amazing as it should be and the bibimbap was delicious. The tang su yuk was a real treat as since leaving Korea I haven't been able to find this anywhere else; I'd recommend anyone who hasn't tried this to do so!

I was stationed in Uijongbu and remembered delicious BBQ places where you can grill at the table. This is a Rolls Royce version of those BBQs. The service is outstanding and the food is delicious and bountiful. I got the Bulgogi entree and my Mom got Dol Sot Bi Bim Bop. We didn’t know that we also got all of these yummy side dishes too. The daughter of the owner came over to check on us. It was an excellent experience. I wondered if their food would taste like the Bulgogi I had in the 80’s back in Korea and it was! I have rated a lot of restauraunts. If I could have given this 6 stars, I would. It was $44 out the door including a generous tip.\n",

They served our choice of proteins thinly sliced and marinated with vegis and then we grilled them at the table. Also came with rice and a variety of Korean side dishes. The staff was very helpful and friendly.\n"

      "465 I ended up going here twice on my most recent visit to London. Once of my own volition and again on the recommendation of a friend - I wasn't complaining. The first time I had the tofu salad and jeon, both OK for vegans, although a couple more members of staff could do with knowing what is and isn't vegan on their menu. These choices were decent if a little greasy. The second time when I went back I had the tofu bibimbap and that was pretty impressive. The restaurant is very close to Victoria station and not all that expensive. It was packed both nights and I would go again.\n",

      "466 A colleague recommended this place as I was meeting a friend straight from work and it was close by. Given that we went on a Monday evening and were starving at 6.30 we figured it would be pretty quiet there but the place was heaving - always a good sign. We had one of the set menus and I have to say it was all delicious. The staff were all friendly and realised that we hadn't had Korean food before so explained how we were supposed to assemble one of the dishes (we'd have worked it out but was nice to be helped) My only slight negative point was that the tea was very weak; I had the Korean tea which had some flavour but my friend had the green tea and said that it tasted of nothing but hot water. I will definitely be back\n",

      "467 What to say other than this place exceeds expectations. I'm very difficult to please when it comes to eating out and really struggled to choose from the menu as everything sounded good. The staff were brilliant, giving us time and answering many questions. I was recommended the kimchi soup which comes with rice. Others had the noodles or bibimbap. When they arrived, portions were huge but with lots of flavour. The bibimbaps were incredible but I think the kimchi soup won hands down. Hot, spicy and full of ingredients I can't wait to come back to have it again. Can't stress enough how great this place is!\n",

      "482 Perfectly located for the Apollo theatre (Wicked), this is a great place for a pre-show meal. They open at 5 and when we arrived at about 5 past there were already 2 tables seated. By half past the restaurant was full and people were waiting. We were asked if we had a reservation (which we didn't) and I would certainly recommend booking if planning to arrive any later than we did. The food was well explained on the menu and the friendly staff were on hand to help make recommendations. Service was extremely quick (in fact we were in and out in just over an hour) and the food is all brought out as soon as it is ready without a clear gap between courses. This might bother some people but I didn't feel like we were being rushed. The food itself was beautifully presented and of good quality. Having not tried Korean food before I found the flavours a little disappointing (slightly bland) compared to some other Asian cuisines, but I think that's more personal taste. Overall I would definitely recommend the place for a value for money pre-show meal if you like Asian food.\n",

We arrived at 5 as it was opening and the staff were lounging about in the dining area so not really a great first impression. As a vegetarian the choice was limited so I had the Tofu Udon and the ladies had Chicken Katsu Udon. The noodles were barely warm and generally the meal was bland and uninteresting. The people on the table across looked to have made a better choice with a colourful rice dish. Perhaps our fault but if experimenting with somewhere for the first time in future I will be asking for recommendations and help from the staff serving.\n"

The place was absolutely heaving, with a queue of people out the door, many or whom were Koreans, though we only had to wait 10 mins or so to be seated. The service was quick and friendly, and we left 40 mins later with smiles on our faces.\n",

      "524 This small, clean, friendly place is perfect for a pre-Hamilton (or whatever show you are seeing at the Palace) repas. Korean food can be light, even vegetarian, spicy or not depending on your preference, and the kimchee won't upset the people sitting next to you in the theatre. I had udon noodles, supposedly spicy; they weren't piquant but they were fresh and umami. My friend had bibimbap with tofu. Both dishes were generous and filling. We shared kimchee pancakes, like potato pancakes but crunchier. Service was unobtrusive and efficient. Arrive early for pre-theatre because it gets crowded the closer you get to show time.\n",

      "528 Went for dinner with my husband and ordered, Cucumber Kimchee, Beef Bimbibap, Spicy Chicken Bulgogi, Kimchee Jigae Ramen. We love the cucumber kimchee and beef bimbibap but the chicken and ramen was too spicy for us. However some people might like the 'spicyness' so this is relative. The atmosphere is typical asian cafe place but it did feel a bit cramp but I think that is because the restaurant was trying to pack as many seats as possible to maximum sales which is understandable. The service was good and the staff was friendly. Also, this place only take cash so bear that in mind. In summary, this is definitely an option for a pre-theatre meal and I would go back again if I am around the neighbourhood and if I crave for Asian food.\n",

The tofu was the best tofu I have ever eaten it was just delicious. It's a really cosy restaurant and because everyone is sitting quite close together you become quite friendly with the people around you if you want to.

It was delicious! A Korean food fan in our group ordered a variety of dishes for us and she was seriously impressed, I just kept eating. The food was fresh and plentiful and superb. So concentrated were we on our dinner, that we’d not noticed the restaurant was packed and folk were waiting.\n",

The decoration is cozy. But the table is a bit close to next table. The food served very quick. The waiter came to explain how we should enjoy the food. He is very friendly and we spend some time to talk to him about Korean culture as well. The food taste so good that make me feel like I am in Korean. We finished our dinner within a hour and people was waiting for the seat. Therefore we left and heading to our show.\n",

      "587 Meeting a friend for lunch we thought we would try Lime Orange. When we arrived it was really busy but there was a table for 4 available so we sat ourselves down and waited to be served. After five minutes we were told that as there was only 2 of us we had to move and join the table behind us. We did ask if we could stay on our table and other people join us but they wanted to keep the table for 4 free just in case a party of 4 walked in. So we joined the other table (although the current occupants were a little taken aback) but there really was not much room for 4 and couldn’t talk freely. Then table for 2 became available so we moved to the free table. We were then told we couldn’t have this table as it had been reserved! So no one waiting. A table for 4 and a table for 2 unused but we could only join a table already occupied by 2 people. At the point we felt very unwelcome and decided to leave. My view on the food can’t be included but we definitively did not feel the love! Looking at other posts it seems we aren’t the only ones dissatisfied with their seating technique. If you want Korean food then give it a try but if there are just 2 or less in your party then find somewhere a bit more welcoming.\n",

We arrived on time to be informed yes they had our reservation but they had no tables available. We would have to wait standing for maybe twenty minutes and then he could squeeze five of us onto a table for four. Said he was sorry and they just overbooked tables. This was said matter of factly -it would appear to be their normal practice. No free drink offered if we chose to wait. We left and found a good restaurant nearby. The front of house staff couldn’t have cared less. With such an indifferent cavalier attitude to customers you have to wonder what happens in their kitchen. Avoid at all costs.\n",

Personally it was bad positioning as it was bitterly cold and every time someone came and went the cold air rushed in and it was not pleasant. Service was good. Food was good but I just feel it is a very tiny restaurant and there are too many tables crammed in and it makes getting comfortable and enjoying your meal not a great experience. I don't like the next table practically sitting in my lap when eating, but of course this is a personal thing and other folk may not mind this.

The staff were quite slow, there was a considerable break between finishing our meal and having the table cleared, no one ever asked if we wanted another drink or dessert, just didn't seem very attentive.

      "691 We went for lunch here before a trip to the theatre. It is quite a small place, but we were able to be seated right away. The menu has the usual Korean favourites, and the sizzling bibimbap dishes in particular looked very good! We had the bulgolgi beef and yukgae jang, with dukbokgi as a starter (which wasn't too spicy), and it was all high-quality. Our waiter was friendly and would helpfully explain to customers the usual way of eating particular dishes.\n",

      "692 When we discovered this local, family-run Korean place 2 years ago it immediately became a big hit with our office - multiple trips per week to begin with, and then settling at a consistent weekly or fortnightly visit ever since. I would bring friends & family here when visiting the city for the weekend, and advocate people go out of their way even to seek it out. Their yangyeum chicken starter was to die for, their bibimbaps tasy, and their pork bulgogi especially good.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, my regular lunch pal and I have noticed a steady decline in portion size and food quality over the last 6 months or so, alongside a slow rise in prices. We have often remarked before while dining here, how pleased we are that this brilliant little friendly restaurant had not succumbed to the trend only too often seen at local establishments that gain popularity - that temptation to try to further increase profit margins by switching to cheaper cuts of meat, changing suppliers (and suffering a noticeable dip in quality), and getting stingy with portions. Unfortunately this has now happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "First our beloved yangyeum chicken - previously so good that we had visited and ordered only two portions of this delicious starter each as our meals - was switched from a generous pile of easy-to-eat boneless chicken (thigh I'd guess?), to chicken wings instead - without any change to the menu I should add. Next, the generous portion was downsized to just 5 wings (tested on multiple occasions for consistency). And finally, the price was actually INCREASED.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now many people very much enjoy chicken wings, so what's wrong with that, you might ask? Well, for the tourists who might wander in once on their visit to see Buckingham Palace, absolutely nothing. But for those living or working locally, we know better. We know what came before. And I'll tell you this for nothing - bitesize pieces of dark meat are far easier to eat cleanly with chopsticks while on an office lunch break or having a business meeting, than fiddly little battered wings smothered in a very sticky spicy-sweet sauce.\n",
      "\n",
      "We've also observed a decrease in the bibimbap sizes, smaller portions of accompaniments, increased greasiness and lower quality of meats (e.g. the belly pork), and further subtle price increases across the menu.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think we feel particularly strongly just because of how much love we had for this place initially, and what a stark contrast there is. The first time we went after they'd made the thigh to wing switch, the waiting staff actually apologized to us for the change when we ordered, knowing full well we'd be disappointed. Now, they simply look at us apologetically when we arrive in the doorway.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sadly, while we've really been trying to keep coming, our regular visits may now have come to an end, the decline has crossed a threshold.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like many of the best things in life, it seems it couldn't last forever.\n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR - if you're in town for the weekend, fancy some Korean and are in the area, you could do far worse than Lime Orange. If however you've been before and loved it, say a year ago or so - don't come back, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n"

Lime Orange was a great place to have a weekday lunch and try a couple of dishes. It's a small, popular, restaurant with friendly staff who wil give you a steer if you need it. A great place to eat if you live or work nearby but not a destination restaurant.\n",

We tried their two course set meal (includes a glass of wine during cup of green tea) and enjoyed the experience.

The food was not remotely satisfying, enough nor delicious and for the portion it was expensive. The beer was not even cold enough. Sorry lime orange this is not good enough! Even delivery to a close destination must be to a high standard\n",

      "705 A little Korean restaurant - 3 mins walk from Victoria station (opposite wicked the theatre show) tucked away next to Russell hotel!! - looks nothing special but the food was sooooo good. Soft drink, starter & main was £15 including tip. they do a set menu for £18.50 including a glass of wine. My friend had the katsu curry with udon noodles & I had the tofu soup. Would go back tomorrow - haven't ever had Korean before but it was busy & bustling - you can book but only over the phone & not on the day. We walked in - we had to pay cash as the machine wasn't working but all good. A little secret gem of you are near Victoria station\n",

      "706 I'd never had Korean food before so I tried the Katsu curry which I've had at Japanese restaurants & really enjoyed so I had a basis for comparison. It was very different but equally tasty, coming with noodles instead of rice and a much tarter and thinner sauce. The green tea ice-cream was also very nice. Service a little slow, although if you intend to make a whole evening of it then that's not really a problem. Small restaurant, I'd advise booking as it's clearly popular at the weekends. I'd go again.\n",

I did because even though I was there at 5:30pm by six it was full and when I left at 6:45 they were queuing outside.

I would never have entered the restaurant had it been by looks alone, as the exterior is not very inviting but once inside the door the room was clean, quite smart and we were shown to our table by a very polite and friendly waiter. We got a table at 5.30 with ease, and soon after the tiny restaurant quickly filled up. We were given advice about food choices. The BBQ chicken was delicious and sizzlingly hot, and the pork bibimbap was equally good. Although we ordered rice with the chicken, we didn't need it as we shared both dishes, and there was plenty for two ladies.\n",

We ordered fried calamari for starters, then bibimbap, soup and noodles with fried chicken. Everything was tasty and stupendous in flavour, texture and temperature.It was our first experience with Korean food, but based on this first encounter I'm sure more will follow. Our daughters, who at first protested as we were visiting 'asian again', really loved the tasty food. Service was fast and helpful and accommodating. Highly recommended!\n",

      "766 Not only is the food fantastic and delicious but the customer service was above and beyond - when my 9 year old couldn't finish her noodles they not only made up a doggy bag but held onto it for us when we went to Wicked (as we weren't allowed to take it into the theatre?!?) so she had the fanciest packed lunch on Monday at school. Double delights! We will definitely visit again - i loved my bimbimbap dish and the calamari starters were perfecct.\n",

      "767 I'm shocked that I have lived in this area for over 10 years and have only now discovered this wonderful local restaurant! It's conveniently located right next to Victoria Station, but unless you are visiting the Apollo theatre (right opposite) or are a commuter taking the bus outside the restaurant, it's easy to miss. Vauxhall Bridge Road certainly isn't the most scenic road, so probably not too many people just going for a stroll in the arae..However, I can only recommend taking a detour for this little gem.\n",

      "All the dishes I have ordered so far have been excellent, I particularly liked their Japchae. Every day they have a different special lunch dish and for £3.99 take away or £4.99 eat-in it's incredible value for money. For London in general, but particularly for this area. Portions are generous!\n",

The food was also really good e.g. the bibimbap. The lighting in the restaurant was a bit dim when you look from afar, so I was mistaken that it's closed until I take a closer look. Glad I didn't turn away in the end!\n",

      "774 I was taken here by a friend. We shared two starters. Both were excellent. I having never had Korean food I was unsure but this put me at ease. For mains we had be sizzling bowls of veg with an intact egg yoke. Mine also had chicken. This was filling and interesting. But not quite at the same level of yumminess but fully palatable and filling. Maybe owing to my own eating style by the end the food had blackened to the metal bowl and was less tasty. To be fair this was just the dregs so shouldn't put people off the food. For desert we had green tea ice cream... the taste of this was excellent. What was more questionable (and I think a marmite option) was the texture. It had green tea in it so was bitty. I am still undecided if I liked it. My friend definitely didn't. However two colleagues at work both said they love the bits! So I guess try and see its only a couple of quid.\n",

Not sure if the staff were on different shift patterns, but the waiter was extremely busy on his own for the 1st hour which was OK for us as we was the first ones in so no issues with service.\n",
      "Jap Chae (Glass noodles) was a bit small for £6.70 for a starter but it was very flavoursome.\n",
      "Bimbibap was excellent and very tasty. BBQ meat was also very good and tasty. Lighting was a bit dark which meant sometimes it was a little hard to tell if the meat was cooked.\n"

      "796 I came to know this restaurant after a series of research in narrowing down the best Korean restaurants that fits our criteria (including price range, location, atmosphere etc). I was a little sceptical at the beginning, as there weren't a lot of reviews on Tripadvisor for this place despite the high ratings. To be fair, Lime Orange isn't one of the most well-known Korean restaurants in town, but we like how it is one of the few that's close to my friend's hotel at South Kensington (as most Korean restaurants are gathered around Tottenham Court Road/Holborn area). The restaurant itself is very easy to find as it is located on the main road, right opposite Apollo Theatre (known as the theatre for Wicked the Musical). Price range is also very reasonable, and the quality of food is no less than that of the better known Korean restaurants (such as Kimchee). The portion of food is also very decent. For appetizers, we had jap chae (a small dish of Korean glass noodles, it was the best jap chae I had in London), vegetable mandu (5 Korean dumplings, they were very crispy) and a small bowl of kimchi (it was quite spicy, but it would be better if there was more depth in flavour rather than spice alone). For main course, we had a beef bibimbap, a kimchi soup pot (which actually gives you a complimentary bowl of rice, but it isn't specified on the menu. I quite like the pork that comes with it) and fried seafood udon (I like the flavours and the wide variety of seafood). Between the four of us, we had a really enjoyable meal as it was a nice casual place to dine and chat. The only downside for us is that the staff could have been a little bit more attentive by serving water regularly or perhaps just look around more often, otherwise everything was perfect. In general though, the staff there are all very friendly. On a final note, the bill came down to £40, which was 10 quid/pp. You definitely get more than you pay.\n",

      "816 I called up yesterday (Wednesday) morning and booked a table for 6pm as was seeing Billy Elliot in the theatre opposite. I booked this with an open mind and was blown away! It's a very small, intimate restaurant that appears to be family run. I had the japchae to start which was beautiful, even if I was the only person in the restaurant to eat with a fork! My partner had the deep fried prawns which were MASSIVE! They looked beautiful but our main meals came out before we'd finished our starters so I didn't get to try the prawns. For main I had the beef bibimbap. I am so glad I went with the crowd. This dish was DELICIOUS. Rice with egg, tasty beef, spinach, onions - absolutely delicious and fun because you get to mix the ingredients and add sauce to your tasting. My Partner had pork belly with lettuce (taco-style). He said his meat was a bit gristly but the flavours were really good, as were the dipping sauces. It is very fast service here which was great as within an hour we had a starter, main, beer, and sake. In total we spent £53 which is a little pricey but definitely worth it for a treat. The sake wine is delicious, as is the Asahi beer. The restaurant picked up in business by about 6.30/7 and had a really nice atmosphere to it. If I go to Victoria Palace Theatre again, I'll be sure to stop here to try something new!\n"

We were there early evening pre theatre and there were plenty of free tables. We loved the green tea ice cream...delicious! Look forward to another visit.\n",

      "In that context, we were very happy to find Lime Orange. The fact that the restaurant was packed was encouraging, so we decided to dive in.\n",
      "I really wanted to like the place, but left disappointed. The problem was that everything we had was desperately bland and lacking in taste. We started with the fried sweet and sour fried chicked. The sweet taste of the sauce decidedly overpowering any chicken that may have been there. Then came the seafood pajeon (korean pancake). It was very anticlimatic, and clearly undercooked. When this was pointed out, they took it back and brought another one after a while…which was not much better. We’ve had much tastier in other places (Asadal for example).\n",
      "Then came the bibimbaps (we had pork and beef), which seemed to be what everyone comes for…\n",
      "This too was so bland we almost cried. My girlfriend had to shower hers in chili sauce for her tastebuds to feel something…anything….\n",
      "It was all just sad.\n",
      "To Lime’s credit, the portions are generous and we did not leave hungry, nor did our evening break the bank.\n",

The first thing that you notice is the attentive service. You are greeted and seated immediately you walk in by very polite, friendly staff. When you are ready to order a waiter or waitress appears straight away and if you look up because you need something else you are quickly attended to. The menu includes Korean favourites and, curiously, a sushi selection. The food is tasty and arrives very quickly. Wine is about the cheapest you will find in this part of London.\n",

Made me think the food was warmed up as it was delivered so quickly. Menu exciting and varied - both Japanese and Korean options and waiter advised on how to choose and select options. Unfortunately I must have chosen a duff off the menu as my Katsu Chicken Udon was far noodles with some deep friend chicken on it. The 'special sauce ' accompanying it was - I swear - Hp brown sauce. Still Udon noodles were tasty. Perhaps I just choose the wrong food but rest of table said things were nice but not great. Unfortunately I think it's a case of a restaurant getting away with serving poor food to a tourist market (it's right near Wicked and Billy Elliot). Touch too expensive for what we got.

The service from the staff is great and the food is delicious, fresh and quick to come out of the kitchen. Also as a vegetarian I felt there was a decent amount of options for me which is always a huge plus.\n",

      "878 I have eaten here twice in the last month. The first time was in a group of 6 before seeing Billy Elliot. The waiter was very patient with us explaining the menu & happily explaining what everyone else was eating as we were looking around. He recommended the Kimchee Jeon as a starter which was delicious. The tempura was plentiful. I'm a vegetarian and had the hot stone pot Tofu Bibimbap. This is a bowl of rice, vegetables and tofu. There is a raw egg yolk on the top that cooks as you mix it all in with chilli sauce (you do this yourself so choose how spicy you want it!). It was delicious!\n",

      "The second time I took my God-daughter as we were seeing Wicked. It's literally over teh road. I had the same again (it was so delicious first time around) and she had the fish Bobimbap - there was plenty of different types of fish and she loved it. Once again brilliant service and delicious food.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some advice definitely call up and book in advance. It's so busy and popular. We booked both times, lots of disappointed people or people who had to wait. It's quite small so there's not lots of room to wait in. Also they prefer cash - they do take cards.\n",

Sake was a definite acquired taste but when taken as a shot disappeared quick lol. I cannot fault my time at this restaurant and recommend it highly, it opened at 12 and we were the first in the door, followed to a virtual full house within 30 minutes so booking could be adviseable.\n",

For main I had the chicken biibimbap which was absolutely lovely, very flavoursome. Very reasonable prices, the staff were attentive but not too much, thankfully. I cannot recommend this little restaurant highly enough. if you want good, tasty Korean food this is the place for you. Probably best to book first as it gets very busy.\n",

You can chose to grill your meat yourself, which is a very fun experience. All the bulgogi meats are tender and full of flavour. The kimchee pancake as a starter is superb, as is the black sesame ice cream for dessert!\n",

We tried a range of dishes, including the Raw Beef Bibimbap, Chicken Katsu Udon, Salmon Teriyaki and Yukgae Jang, and teverything we had was bursting with flavour and well prepared. This is good Korean food, with plenty of options to include everyone (now also very curious about their sushi too)\n",

The classic Korean dish bibimbap was fantastic, and seems to be especially popular, but it's a very large portion for one. The wine was great too. We'll definitely be going back. It's very easy to get to - very near to Victoria station.\n",

      "891 Popped in for an early dinner before a gig and to sample our first taste of Korean food. We were not disappointed! There was plenty to chose from on the menu and the staff were happy to advise choices to our taste. We shared some chicken dumplings to start which were lovely. I had the pork bulgogi which was really, REALLY good! I had it with lettuce and rice as advised (and costs extra); you wrap it and eat with your hands - yum. It was a big portion and I thought the rice was unnecessary - but the lettuce was a nice fresh way to serve and enjoy the pork and I might try it at home. The other half had katsu chicken with udon noodles - it was also really tasty and a good generous portion. We were both chuffed, especially as he works a stones' throw and will be able to pop in and enjoy the lunchtime specials. Location is very convenient for Victoria, just a 2 minute walk, behind the Apollo theatre.\n"

We booked for 5pm, when they open and for first 15mins we were the only ones there but it soon started to fill up so booking is a must. The waiter was attentive & helpful but not intrusive, recommending dishes etc. The food was lovely and very tasty and it was very filling. I thought the prices were reasonable, 2 starters, 2 main courses, 3 sides, 2 puddings, large glass of wine, coke & bottle of water was £55 inc service charge.

We stayed in Lime Orange until all other diners have left. We left the restaurant at 10:50pm and then we noticed the closing time was 10:30pm!! How kind was the staff not to patronise us regarding the closing hour. We were so grateful and slightly embarrassed for keeping her so late! I'm regretting not to apologising to her back then, I might do so the next time I come to Lime Orange again.\n",

We also ordered Beef Bibimbap and Beef Bulgogi. The waiter recommended lettuce and rice with the Beef Bulgogi and neglected to mention there was an extra charge for both the rice and the lettuce. There was also a 10% service charge added to the bill. I suggested he add a statement to the menu noting the extra charge for the rice and the lettuce. He good naturedly removed the excess charges. The 10% service charge was not amended and no record of our meal was provided following our cash payment. We would eat here again in spite of non disclosure of costs involved.\n",

With positive reviews and nobody being overly au fait with Korean food it was decided that Lime Orange would be the place for us!\n",

      "The staff were friendly and accommodating at the beginning. Having not tried Korean before our likes and dislikes were taken into account before recommendations were offered for starters and mains.\n",
      "\n",
      "But after that I would have to say that service was average at best. Although the food service was rather slow, especially considering we were one of four tables in that evening, I would never complain when the food is as good as it was. However, we did outline upon arrival (at 8.30pm) that our colleague needed to leave at 9.45pm for a conference call but come 9.40pm he still didn't have his main meal. Not a problem normally but our circumstances meant this caused quite the issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "What irked me the most was the general service, which was a shame after such a positive start. In between serving and going to kitchen the staff stood with their back to the restaurant chatting among themselves by the till. This made it nigh on impossible to place a drinks order and it took me leaning across into their conversation to get their attention for the water we had ordered 10 minutes earlier.\n",
      "\n",
      "The restaurant bills itself as Korean BBQ and there are even gas grills built into some of the tables. Our table had one but the only downer of taking the recommendations were that none of our dishes incorporated a BBQ element, which in hindsight seemed odd and an opportunity missed by the staff.\n",
      "\n",
      "Service aside it must said the food was very, very good. Everything was fresh, tasty and the we all thoroughly enjoyed every dish we shared from the pickled beansprouts, vegetable dumplings, extremely refreshing cucumber dish to the lemon chicken, noodles and beef - to name but a few....I think we over ordered somewhat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another big bonus was the price. 4 people, multiple bottles of beer, wine, two courses each and sharing sides all came in at a very reasonable price of around £20 per head.\n",
      "\n",
      "These two final points are the reason I have bumped this up from Average to Very Good. Poor service can easily be corrected and can be down to the individuals on the night but food of this quality at this price deserves to be shouted about.\n"

      "926 My daughter and I visited this restaurant a few nights ago for pre-theatre dinner and it was really good. Our server was extremely helpful and efficient, and the food delicious, although the cinnamon punch was not my thing! I will definitely return if I'm back in the area.\n",

      "927 I have been to this restaurant twice I suppose. The experience was pretty good for me, although my Korean friend wasn't too satisfied. It served Japanese food previously but now I suppose they focus on Korean food which probably is a right decision as they are Korean not Japanese. I had Pajeon and Bibimbap, Pajeon was crispy and lots of seafoods are mixed too, though my Korean friend told that they already prepared it a while ago and reheated (re-panfried) again now, which you never know... at least for me it was crispy and nice :-) Stone-bowl of Bibimbap was well heated so that you have a little bit of burnt rice that I really appreciate. Korean lady seems smiley and nice, I think it's a nice little Korean restaurant in Victoria.\n",

The restaurant is an odd shape so you kind of feel like you are sitting at your neighbours table but for the price it is fine! Also have Korean beer.\n",

We were brought a jug of water without asking for it, service on a Friday evening was good. We thought that under £40 for two three course meals and one drink each was very reasonable and we were certainly well fed! Ideal place for a quick pre theatre meal. Will visit again.\n",

      "934 This place is a little hidden gem! It's a small restaurant and can be easily missed. But I'm so glad we found it. The service was very good and attentative and the food was excellent! It was my first time eating Korean BBQ and the server was extremely helpful with suggestions and guidance. The food was very flavorful, the portions were generous. The sushi portion was the biggest I have ever seen! And very well done sushi! The Bibmbap was super tasty! We had leftovers and we were sad we couldn't pack them up.\n",

      "935 I visited Lime Orange twice already: the first with my gf and second with family. The reception was great (they are always smiling and willing to help) and the food was different, but easy to please. Bibimbap is a must, and I would recommend the Korean BBQ together if in a bigger group! Oh, the ambient looks a little fancy, but it's cheaper than a lot of good pubs and restaurants.\n",
      "감성을 입력하세요1\n",
      "936 After a long day this was the perfect first diner of our holidays. All the dishes were especially tasty (Udon chicken, fried buttered prawns, glas noodles, even the fried rice!). The beef Bulgogi was a special experience as you roll it yourself in a cabbage leave. Try the Korean ricewine Makgeolli: cool and milky. The service was very friendly and attentive. The kid's special wishes and dietary changes were gladly accepted. We will for sure come again.\n",

      "Value for money and authenticity, this place is a good option with no immediate competition in this part of London. For aficionados, you might find the pajun a tad bit tired looking.

      "When we arrived it was around 5pm and the place was empty but after reading the positive reviews we went in.\n",
      "There was a very pleasant male staff member in charge, we ordered starters and mains, we both had the Bibimbap for our main meals which is an authentic korean dish that comes in a sizzling dish and has lot of various ingredients......and an egg yolk, the waiter explained that you add chilli sauce and mix it all up yourself, it was absolutely delicious!\n",
      "\n",
      "my only slight complaint is that the main meals arrived whilst we were still eating our starters (and we are by no means slow eaters!) but in fairness this my be a bit of a cultural difference and it didn't cause us any problems, (especially for the fact that the Bibimbap came in a red hot dish so retained its heat)\n",

      "944 I really enjoyed my Korean experience and I would definitely go again. Take advice from the friendly staff as to what to eat. The dishes served to our table of 7 all were beautifully presented and the flavours of them matched this. Price was ok, and the restaurant is very close to Victoria Station and the theatres near by. It is a small restaurant plain and clean. Service was good. The toilets could have been a little cleaner and the space provided for this facility is very small. But I am not really complaining, just pointing out this fact!\n",

      "945 The shop looks a little shady. Initially we were not sure about it, but since there was nothing more alluring in the vicinity, we decided to go for it. To our surprise, it was really good. The korean fried rice was really good and spicy enough (for asians who love extra spiciness). Had another dish with 4 types of meat (can't remember what the dish is called) but it was really tasty as well. The meats were well-marinated.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only thing I really hate about it is the horrible lighting, it was difficult to eat in the extremely orange lights. Aside from that, I'd totally recommend it! :)\n"

      "946 On our second night in London we felt for some asian food. I am in to korean food and my wife love the japanese kitchen. We checked TA and found Lime Orange and decided to try it. Located only 2 min walk from Victoria Station it was very easy to get to. We were there pretty early, about 17:30, and we were seated directly. Service was very nice the whole time. We had one of the set menues and some sake. All courses was perfect and you won't leave Lime Orange hungry 'cos you get big portions. It is in my opinion not pricey, especially not considering the quality of the food. Our bill came out at £55 for 5 dishes and a bottle of sake. I'm pretty sure I've found my favourite place in London here.\n",

Certainly recommend this if you are in the area.\n",

      "951 I went here solo on a Monday night and had the chicken bibimbap, it was wonderful and I ate every bite. Came back on a Tuesday and had the kimchi fried rice. It was good but not as good as the bibimbap. My favorite part about Korean food is the banchan, so on the second visit i ordered the mixed banchan (called something else on the menu) and it came with pickled bean sprouts, radish, cucumber and the green spinach-like vegetable. It was not was I was used to. What I typically love was not done right, so skip this. The cucumber was extremely vinegary and sweet, inedible. The greens and bean sprouts were ok. So my suggestion so far is to stick with the bibimbap. I'll go back again for that!\n",
      "감성을 입력하세요1\n",
      "952 Hadn't tried Korean food before so this was a pleasant surprise. The waitress assisted us with our menu choice and although I can't remember the name of the dish we shared it was a platter of 4 different meats that came with rice and lettuce leaves - it was ideal for us.\n",

      "953 I did some research before going in to London with my daughter for a service at Westminster Cathedral. We like to try out different cuisines so gave Lime Orange a go based on reviews on Tripadvisor. We were not disappointed. This restaurant is at the 'unfashionable' end of Vauxhall Bridge Road and looks uninspiring from the outside. Step inside and it looks like a cafe, no scenic views from the window. But, the service is flawless, the food great and If you are new to this, they will advise you. Terrific fresh food, served quickly, great prices. Loved it !!\n",

(I really want to find an excuse to visit again so I can have another!)\n",
      "The Bibimap continues to cook in front of you, so the flavour and texture developed throughout the meal. Each dish was flavoured brilliantly and tasted fresh.\n",

Lovely modern decor inside, really fast wireless Internet, service with a smile and really really great Chicken Katsu Udon. I am a huge fan of Udon noodles and rarely manage to find a place that makes them just so. Needless to say I fell for this place and went right back the next day even though we weren't going to watch a musical afterwards. If you're a fan of noodles or Asian food, do give it a try! :)\n",

The waiter explained the menu and made some recommendations on ordering the lettuce to wrap around the meat which was very helpful as this was our first experience of Korean food. The food was excellent, well cooked and tasty although I would have welcomed a gap between our starters and main course, which arrived before we'd finished eating. Prices were reasonable for both the food and the wine and I'd definitely go back.\n",

No singing-dancing show was featured this particular evening and staff lacked sufficient communication skills outside Korean or Chinese. Kim Bap, Bibimbap and Kimchi were of excellent quality and very reasonably priced, however the Korean beer was grossly overpriced (i.e. a single 500 ml bottle costing more than most individual dishes).

Watch out for the solo drum performance- my favorite. It was amazing to watch how the waitresses continue to serve whilst in between their costume changes. Pricing is relatively high for Phnom Penh standard but worthwhile for the experience.

I would say most items are overpriced in this place, but you probably already guessed it.\n",

      "The main highlight starts around 730-ish after the first few plates were served. The waitresses gave a warm up song and dance, distributed bouquets of plastic flowers to each table (Hell, I thought I was given one for being cute). A chubby girl sat behind the drums and delivered a heart-thumping solo. There were dances in traditional costumes; look out for the thin but dazzlingly beautiful girl who is the designated \"spinner\", her part of the dances include several whirling solo (think of a female whirling dervish you would propose marriage to, in a heartbeat)\n",

      "Dragging on into the early evening, you would sample 60s karaoke korean songs (imagine very tamely-dressed Korean pop groups), a saxophone solo of \"The moon represents my heart\" by another gorgeous girl, and some more song and dances with electric guitars (we caught one girl finger-syncing to the music) and accordion (the national musical instrument for DPRK).\n",

I felt they were quite friendly, especially considering that the place was full and only a handful of girls had to run the entertainment, change costumes repeatedly, and act as waitresses. The girl who played the yanggeum (Korean dulcimer) and the girl who played the drums were amazing. If you consider that all the girls could speak Korean, Chinese, and at least a little bit of English, and could dance and play instrumetns and wait tables well, it is truly amazing. I was given a bouquet of flowers used during the show at the end by one of the girls (although I wasn't able to take it home). I have spent a lot of time in South Korea and in Asia in general and I can speak Chinese, so maybe I felt less culture shock in general and was able to understand some of what they were saying with other customers. They could speak English also, some more than others, but that was ok, because if one could not understand or respond well, she could get another. The restaurant is connected to the North Korean government from what I have read, the girls might come from elite families, the politics might be distatsteful, but a stand alone review should give it a very high rating. The girls were very remarkably talented and were friendly, the bibimbap was terrific. The hors d'ouevres were not remarkable, but I can't think of any time in my life where I got a show, a meal, and a cultural experience for 15 dollars including a glass of ginseng wine.\n",

      "982 went here for the show and dinner and, in some ways, its quite an experience. by luck we arrived right before the show. food was overpriced but the show was free. the food was standard korean, cold buckweat noodles, sweet and sour pork ribs, etc, and was pretty decent. the show however is the main attraction. its bizzare, like an 80s japanese pop music performance interspersed with random mini acts. the girls sing, play mozart on the violin, do some traditional dances etc, all choreographed to strobe lights and disco balls. they pretend to be happy and laugh the whole time, but you can tell they are not. in fact its known they are basically slaves and going to the restaurant is considered unethical by some, so three stars. im american and went to see north koreans with my bare eyes. one of the servers touched my hand during the meal. interesting.\n",

      "The menu is extensive but many people make the mistake of ordering Chinese dishes. This mistake will negatively color your experience. My recommendation: order a large bowl of very special cold Pyongyang noodles (one per person as these are not sharable) and the kim chee. You will not be disappointed and you will feel that the meal and entertainment were a tremendous value. This is one of those extremely delicious meals I can still taste and dream of having again...\n",

It was my first time meeting North Koreans and it was equally unnerving and exciting at the same time. They don't speak English so we ordered in Korean (they speak much differently than South Koreans, but it's understandable). The cold noodle soup (they call it \"rengmyun\") was really good and made the authentic old-fashioned way without any artificial ingredients liks MSG. They asked us about life in America and once my wife got to talking, they wouldn't leave our tableside. In fact, 2 of them stayed by our table for the entire meal, which gave me a bit of indigestion. They were obviously curious. In the end, it was a unique experience that I couldn't have at home and that was worth the price (which is more typical of what you'd pay in America for this kind of meal).\n",

Don't think for a minute that this a social enterprise, just a way for the NK gov't to get some exposure and money. Food was plentiful and well-prepared, if you like vats of kimchee with everything.

It's more of a bizarre banquet hall with live shows every night, alternating between rock shows and traditional dancing. Enjoying a beer while watching a 20 year old North Korean girl rocking out to a manic drum solo is priceless. Also priceless is trying to convince the staff, who are all the chosen few who get to leave North Korea for the green pastures of Cambodia, that they should pop to an internet cafe on their lunch break and explore the wonderful world of google.\n",

      "8 I have been to several North Korean restaurants in several cities, they are pretty similar in many ways. Nothing special if you have been to a North Korean restaurant, but if you are familiar with the Korean food often seen in South Korea, some dishes with the same names are worth tasting. North Koreans make kimchi with a different way, very unique. Not the best place if you expect a conversation with your friends, because their music is loud and are the reason a lot of people going there for, and who knows what the waitresses would do when they hear what you are talking about, they all speak Khmer, English and apparently Korean very well.\n",

      "9 In the middle of Phnom Penh you'll find this strange place. The waitresses - all very beautiful and look exactly the same - are sent here from North Korea and stay for about three years. The purpose: to \"inform\" us about how fantastic there home country is.\n",

      "At 7.30 (this was on a Friday) the show started. All of a sudden our waitresses stopped serving food and got on stage. They danced something that reminded me of Sound of Music. And then they sang Honey, honey (Abba) and one of the played the violin good enough to get a job in any simphony orchestra. In the end they picked up three electric guitars and played.\n",

They show was amazing, I enjoyed it a lot, I was totally awed by the way they spun and twirled, and the many many instruments that could play! They don't allow you to take pictures inside, but they won't ask you to delete your photos either once you get your chance to. The food was okay, but just order a simple dish or something and just enjoy the show!\n",

      "12 Heard a lot about this place. One of our visitors said was his favorite restaurants in Phnom Penh--could not wait to try it. It was interesting and unusual from a Western perspective, but definitely not as freaky as others might think. The food was good, not the best Korean food I have ever had (had North Korean food in Seoul which was better). The pork ribs and bimbimbap at a hot stove pot was pretty good. The dumpling and the vegetable dish were nothing to write home about. The waitresses were definitely quite talented, well-dressed and well-groomed. My friends thought they look angry from time to time--they were a bit stressed since they had to wait on all customers and to perform as well. Don't expect that they will come by to chat with you. The waitresses and the show definitely were trying to reinforce the traditional expectation of women being very thin, submissive and gentle. No wonder most of the patrons there tonight were males. Who knows how much of the show were truly north Korean or modified to feed a particular expectation? The restaurant is closed by 9 pm which I did not expect. Overall not very memorable, food was only alright--would not likely go back as the place did allow smoking which always put a big dent on the overall dining experience.\n",

      "But the best part of the restaurant is the waitresses and the videos. All waitresses are made to look like dolls and perform in between serving your food. Expect anything from a covering of Celine Dion to hardcore rock music. My waitresses hurriedly dropped food at my table and rushed to get on stage. It was quite the spectacle. And then there are the videos. Lush landscapes and beaches, which I assume are meant to project N.Korea is a good light.\n",

      "15 This restaurant is at the main road of Monivong Bld. We were sceptical after reading the reviews n possible motives behind it, however we decided to try it since we will never visit Pyongyang. Yes,all the waitresses are dressed in yellow n red chiffon hanbok,same shoes,same scrunchy n similar hairstyle etc. They are soft-spoken, pretty n friendly with the Korean guests. The food is rather similar to South Korean's,or it's just those dishes that we ordered. The kimchi with pork ($8) was good, not sour or too oily. The dog soup ($12) is probably an acquired taste, with lots of spice n some chilli. The boiled mackerel fish ($10) is yummy for fish lovers. Jinro Soju is a tad too expensive for our liking, at $6. The performance starts at 8pm, with the waitresses singing, dancing n playing guitar, drum, keyboard n gu zheng! Very impressive! Definitely worth a visit for the curious, but pls bear with those ppl smoking in the air-conditioned restaurant.\n"

I felt really wierd being there as its like supporting the North Korean Government who didn't get this well known by being happy fluffy hippies. The waitresses are cold and unsmiling (only my male mates were too impressed by them to tell. Hand picked apparently...). After half an hour of kimchi and incredibly expensive beer, they launched into this colourful, whirling, screeching show with \"happy\" smiling faces for the best part of an hour before going back to being grim and austere again. The place has the weirdest vibe of anywhere I've ever been. There wasn't much after dinner banter. I think we were all in a little shock.

The highlight was the waitresses rocking out on electric guitar, bass guitar and a drum solo.\n",

The waitresses are a highlight, wearing very bright almost brides dresses, they are very friendly and speak perfect English........BUT then......they double as the cast of the most fantastic restaurant show I have seen.

We do enjoy Korean bbq, first we ordered vegetable Goyza whilst waiting for the bbq to warm up. We then had a selection of dishes, beef in beer, chicken, mushrooms, spuds etc along with lettuce, rice and chilli and garlic for me to give the meal an extra kick. The dishes did come out rather haphazardly, indeed the potatoes which took the longest to cook came out last. House wine is great value at around £13 a bottle, there’s beer to inc. Hite if you want something Korean. Service is slightly random, though tbf it was very busy when we arrived. Food is good though, and overall we certainly enjoyed our meal. And at £50 excl service it’s good value. Btw it’s cash only here (plenty of cash points nearby).\n",

The quality of food here is excellent and they’re kimchi is the best I’ve ever had in terms of UK Korean restaurants, the portions are big and the prices are cheap; mains are around £8-9, starters are around £5 each. The service is basic at best, the staff are efficient but not too attentive. They also do not accept card so it’s cash only, which is a downside. I loved the seafood bibimbap and spicy tofu jigae, both tasted divine. Overall high quality flavorful and authentic Korean food, cheap prices, generous portions but average service.\n",

First of all, the one waitress at the place was absolutely rude, she had the worst scowl on her face and had kept pinning everything she did wrong on somebody who had little English skills as we had previously mentioned to the woman. She had ‘misheard’ one of the orders (which to me when she was taking the orders looked like she didn’t give a flying toss). When we explained she got the order wrong she gave us the dirtiest look and told us we were wrong and spent 30 minutes trying to get us to eat something we did not order and when we finally received what we had originally ordered it was once again not the right food! We had pointed specifically to braised chicken bulgogi with bbq sauce which we pointed at the photo which we revived a dish which we did not order. After finishing the food we received the bill and split it between 7 of us and 2 of the girls left shortly after. As soon as the girls had left the waitresses came over to tell us that they messed the bill up and it went from £78 to £85 which I must say we are 15 and some of us do not have a lot of money and would have helped if they could have told us before the girls had left.

We also enjoyed the tteokbokki and the bulgoki. The bibimbap was slightly disappointing, but the overall experience was brilliant. Also, nice music.\n",

I had soybean paste stew and Bibimbab. The stew was so salty and less ingredient, I think if they put more tofu or other vegetables in the stew, it would be better. And my friend said the Bibimbab has to much rice and less vegetables and meats. Maybe, I can make better dishes than this restaurant. Also, I don't know why they are only available cash. I had to withdraw money from near ATM...\n",

      "65 I’ve always eaten here because I like the ambience of the restaurant. It looks way better than typical restaurant in most China town. I’ve also always loved eating Korean foods so no matter which restaurant I order it from I’m still gonna like it. However, the staff needs more training as they all seemed to be young student girls with no experience in customer service. Once you have your food on your table they don’t ask you anymore whether everything is okay or not. One time I had to call the attention of the waitress for 3 times and she still didn’t come to our table because they were busy (showed they were short of staff too and can’t handle busy shifts). I saw the manager (I assume she is) lowkey telling off the waitress when she didn’t know the name of the food she was serving. There were times too when the food order took so long to arrive on the table and not at the same time. They’ll bring one after the other! (Again, it showed slow service from the kitchen). Like I said I love Korean foods but the service in this restaurant needs improvement. Oh, i was surprised when i saw that they charge you for service charge when you don’t get the service you deserve to get anyway.\n",

We ordered drinks before my daughter went to the cash point I waited and the staff served the other familes arounf us despite us being seated first, did not want to bring the drinks out until she was back it was across the road in view of the restaurant. The food it's self over cooked tough, under seasoned and plain tasting. Was not enjoyable at all. The service was appalling it was like we was a burden to them the it was a shambles out starters we were brought one starter out of 3 and it took another 25mins before it was received. We had our mains before our starter arrived. Ended up just paying for what was ordered and leaving. Still hungry, disappointed.\n",

      "We ordered samgyupsal(belly pork) bbq, soy bean soup and kimchijeon (kimchi pancake). The kimchijeon came first, unusually it seemed to have been deep-fat fried and so had a slightly crisp coating but still tasted quite good. The soy bean soup was good though a little low on chillies. The samgyupsal was somewhat disappointing - rather than the thick meaty strips of the home country, this was more reminiscent of bacon; thin and overly fatty. Despite that, it was an enjoyable meal, coming to £32.00 for the three dishes plus sides and drinks. Is certainly go back to see how the other food compares!\n"

We were the only customers for a while. It gave us time to ask lots of questions about the food and the numerous options. Two of us chose the cook yourself BBQ option and two had terryaki dishes. The beef terryaki was delicious and it was a novelty to cook on the grill. The rest of the food was good verging on ok. We didn't appreciate the additional 'tax' added onto the bill but had been very happy with our young waitress and the service she provided.

First up was the Korean tea...............very much an acquired taste too 'woody' for me. We ordered an appetizer to share (Belly Pork with Kimchi) which was rather a large dish. I felt it would have been better served with rice or noodles as it had a rich salty/ spicy taste to eat alone. The main courses were chicken Bibimbap and Seafood Udon Noodles. Both dishes were very tasty and filling. The bibimbap was an unusual dish as it is a very hot stone/ clay pot with rice at the bottom topped by vegetables and meat of your choice then a raw egg. The idea is to mix it all together before you eat it. Almost as if you are stir frying the dish!\n",

No apologies about this whatsoever. After a while, the owner came out very rude and arrogant saying they do not care if we don't like the taste of the food as to them it tastes okay. They tasted my leftovers as well. Wtf. Horrible experience. I will not be coming back ever. Probably will put a formal complaint as well after how we were treated.\n"

The new grills seemed easy to use and the waitress fired it up as soon as we ordered. We piled in with beef, prawns, omelette, seafood tempura and kimchi. It was great watching our prawns and beef griddle while we supped on beer and Korean tea (which has overtones of vanilla). We got lettuce with the beef (which made it great to make beef, barbecue sauce and kimchi parcels). The omelette/pancake was every bit as good as I had hoped after seeing Judy Joo make one on a TV programme. The prawn, fish and vegetable tempura were delicious, crispy with firm flesh and even better when dipped in soy sauce. The kimchi.was really fiery. There was far too much to eat but they kindly boxed the leftovers for us. The waitresses are friendly and efficient. It surprises me that so few brummies visit this place: most of the clientele were oriental. The food is delicious and £56 was not too bad considering how much we ordered.

We got our drinks and the dishes started to arrive but after some time we were ignored. Our requests for drinks were ignored and after the first 3-4 dishes we ordered we had to wait 15-20 mins for the remainder of the dishes to arrive. It was then we noticed that the place wasn't that busy but they were serving dishes to the other tables that had arrived after us. The BBQ and seafood pancake was delicious and the bibimbap and teriyaki eel was passable. But the worst of all was the soft tofu stew. It was nothing like we had ever tried before. It was lacking in flavour and was more like a clear soup with bits of tofu, cucumber and one egg in it.

This is quite useful as some of the dishes a either quite spicy or served raw. They're also happy to anglosise a dish for you too, if what they're serving is a bit weird for you. Every table is equipped with a barbecue grill too, and this looks fun.

(A lot of the menu is meat which you have to cook yourself on a built in grill on the table so I guess if you ordered that then your food would be super hot)\n",
      "The reason the review is 4* and not 5* is that at the back of the restaurant there is some kind of function room or bar area, which generated a lot of loud noise throughout our dining experience, also, where we were sat was directly opposite the door and every time anyone went in or out the door stays open so we were repeatedly having to ask for the door to be closed as it was really cold. I understand the weather can't be helped and there are limited seats, we hadn't booked, so our table was probably one of the worst positions and if we had only had to ask once for the door to be closed I wouldn't mention it - it was the fact that even though the staff knew we were cold when the door was open and were stood and could clearly see (and feel) the door was open, they waited for us to ask before they closed it.\n",
      "Overall though, a good experience.\n",

      "112 Celebrating a friends birthday so a small group. Keen to try something new we went for a set menu consisting of starters and main followed by ice cream. Starters was soup followed by something similar to dim sum. This was lovely and there was plenty of it. Then came main course which consists of various meats, vegetables and sauces which you cook for yourself using the hot plate in the centre of the table - think fondue style. Bit of a novelty factor which soon wore off as I eat out for someone to cook for me! Good to try/experience but if I went again I'd get something else. All of the food was lovely though.\n",

      "114 i gave this place a try as the other Korean restaurant 'Toppokki' across the road in china town seemed too busy. The food was absolute garbage from the frozen breaded prawn starters to a kimchi stew which tasted hideous, I felt like i could taste tomato ketchup in the soup. The service was pretty appalling, had to go out of my way to get the attention of the waitress who was frowning the entire evening. No authenticity, horrible tasteless bland food which is nothing like Korean home cooked food, poor service. If only I could give zero ratings.\n",

      "After a busy week I thought I'd take the evening off and eat out to save time and work, but ended up having to throw all of my clothes, including my coat and my backpack, into the wash. I left the restaurant smelling very strongly of food due to the lack of air circulation and extraction. Also, the floor tiles were so slippery that I nearly fell over, which says something as I was wearing sensible shoes with non-slip Vibram soles. Other customers were similarly shuffling and sliding along in their sneakers to avoid slipping.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall good food, but not a relaxing experience and it created far more work than if I had stayed at home and cooked for myself.\n"

All started off well, waitress was friendly & explained the different meals. We ordered & then we waited 35 minutes for drinks & then our meals came 1 after the other - my wife's first after 50 minutes them mine 10 minutes later & my children then waited a further 10 minutes for their meals. It's not as if we ordered anything out of the ordinary. It's was very annoying knowing my children were hungry & me & my wife had our meals eventually but they still hadn't had theirs. The waitress said there was a mix up with the order which I couldn't understand because everything was from their menu & numbered. How easy could it be - the place wasn't busy so there was no excuse at all & the apologising during our meal got very irritating - too cap it off the waitress apologised again & then said they wouldn't charge the 10 % service charge. We couldn't wait too get out of there & would never return - the food is okay, the portions are mediocre & the prices are expensive for what it is but I will emphasise I will keep to what I know & stick ' Cafe Soya' in the future\n",

      "124 First time I've had a Korean meal, came across this place on TripAdvisor and read the reviews as protocol. The place was only 30metres from where I was so took a look with my own eyes. When it comes to eating out, the number one thing that friends ask me is, \"where can I get good Indian food?\" (I'm of Indian origin) and my answer is always the same, \"wherever you see Indian people eating\". I followed my own advice and opted to dine at Miss Korea as this is where Koreans were eating. They have the raw menu where you can cook your own meat on the built in grill on your table, like a self serve teppan yaki but my friends and I opted for the cooked choices. We enjoyed a smokey chicken teriyaki sizzling on the iron plate, the sweet and spicy chicken, veg noodles and the some of the crispiest tempura in a light and fresh batter. Sides of cucumber relish and kimchi. To not cloud the flavour we stuck with water as it was our first experience of Korean cuisine. We thoroughly enjoyed the meal and at the end we took guesses as to the bill, it came in under a third under our estimates! Full of flavour and excellent value, goes to show you have to try things and make your own opinions.\n",

Thanks to other reviewers, we were dressed prepared for the smoky BBQ environment and had we not been warned, we would have been pretty annoyed if we had turned up in our Sunday best only to find we needed to literally strip as we walked into our home and everything went into the wash and bodies in the shower! However, if you are prepared, it really is worth it. The only criticism is the \"excuse\" of the card machine being \"still\" out of order, we wondered if it had ever worked. We thought it would have given a better impression to simply state cash only up front as it would not deter us from eating there again at all. The food itself is enough to draw in customers.\n",

If this place can manage it it should hire some Korean waiting staff it would provide even more genuineness in the dining experience.\n",

Her attitude towards us, was like she didn't care about anything and just wanted to go home. After our order was taken, we had to wait rather long for our food to arrive and then when it finally arrived some dishes were missing. For example the meats arrived but the lettuce and rice were nowhere to be found and it seemed that the waitress had forgotten about them.

The food itself took a really long time to arrive, with the first main arriving close to fifteen minutes before the last. I found the starter (sadly I forgot the name, it looks like a deep fried pancake folded in half over some filling) and my main (bulgogi chicken with veg and rice in a hot stone bowl) generally bland and even a tad sickening in taste. The only redeeming quality of the main was the meat, which was delicious, but scarce. On the other hand, I really enjoyed the beef bulgogi and beer marinated beef that we could grill ourselves. They were absolutely delicious, but too felt like very little meat for £6+ per plate.\n",

      "As another review points out, the service is terrible. The waiting staff pay no attention to what goes around them (we had to raise our voice to borderline shouting in order to get their attention from a meter away), the two waitresses seem very timid and even scared. Another lady, who appears to be their manager, has a very hostile air about her, made no effort to seem welcoming when talking to us and berated the two girls in the plain view of customers. When they do appear, the waitresses would come to the table, take the utensils and stir the meat on the grill after seeing you do it, before walking off without a word? Empty plates were not taken away from the table through the meal and once again the staff had to be almost shouted to in order to tell them that we would like our bill.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, I wasn't very impressed with the restaurant apart from the novelty of the grill, which I did enjoy. As far as I understand the food isn't very authentic, and isn't a great representation of quality of Korean food. The service is poor and I felt like I overpaid for the little food that I did eat. I told my friends I stopped eating because I had enough and wasn't hungry any more, whichever as true enough, but the cause of that was a lack of appetite, and not a full stomach. The only reason I can see myself coming back to Miss Korea is for the grill meats, and exclusively that.\n",

The starters of chicken dumplings and fried vegetables were nice and the edamame fresh but it was when the table top cooker was opened up and I was presented with freshly lightly fried pork, squid, prawns, mussels and salmon I realised how good the cuisine was. All of this at a bargain price. I shall come back again\n",

The friends we went with had been several times before. I really enjoyed the dish I had with eel, as did one of our friends. My partner had a beef dish and the other friend had tofu. The kimchi and other side dish were very spicy but delicious and gave us something to nibble before our main dishes arrived. Drinks were good too - I had a soya drink, one friend had beer and the two men shared a spirit which, whilst good at the time had rather an unfortunate hangover as an after effect. Probably best avoided! We were not hustled or harassed and were able to enjoy a very happy evening chatting and enjoying good food. We'll definitely return and hope to try some of the other dishes next time. Thank you miss Korea.\n",

Went again today and food was of average quality and prices for the dishes seemed more expensive. we ordered food and drinks including a seafood pancake which was way too small also the portions of bibbimbap were too small even my son (10 years old) complained of being still hungry after the meal.

Nice friendly restaurant with BBQ facility in the center of each table allowing you to cook your own meal if you so desire. Its not a 5* restaurant so don't walk in there with high expectations of glitz and glamour, or outstanding Ritz table service. The prices are reasonable and the service is absolutely fine.

We were shown to the table after 5 minutes by the waitress whereas the owner chose to stand behind the bar watching. The first dish came half an hour later and still no sign of drinks. It was busy so it was understandable that the food would take awhile but we ordered around half 7 and only just had the main dishes served around half 8/9. The bbq was turned off so we asked the owner to check for us and then he told us the bbq on this table was broke and and he asked us to moved, I questioned him why it took them so long to let us know that and he blamed it on the waitress, he asked the waitresses and she confirmed that it wasn't brokenand then he pushed her away and got the kitchen to cook our meat inside.

The gyoza were better than wagamama. The other dishes were interesting and made a change from Chinese/Japanese/Thai. There was plenty of food but not too much. It came to £61 which I thought was good value, we only had soft drinks. Only point to improve was that the ladies loo could have been a bit cleaner.\n"

It sounds like some people have had a bad experience, but really in my eyes it was very positive. The menu offers great choice but doesn't give you too much support if you're not familiar with Korean cuisine, that said it compared favourably to my previous experience with Korean restaurants. The food was quick, well presented, seasoned and flavoured and good value. The drinks a little more expensive but not out of sync with other restaurants. We didn't have any experience with the tap water, but in fairness to them at least they're up front about it. The service was attentive, no waiting at all to be helped, there was no checking-in on your enjoyment during the meal which is a little unusual but really not an issue for me.

We though we'd give it a go. After driving around Gulf hotel apartments twice I had to get out of the car to walk around a little but eventually found it. Location could be better however that's all made up for when you try the food.\n",

The order came with an amazingly zestful tasty cold soup and a lot of sides and sauce . From the moment this stuff hit my tastebuds I was in heaven and I have now added Korea to one of those places one must visit before they die if only just for the food. Fragrant, aromatic, mouth watering, and satisfying. We will definitely be back don't care what the naysayers have to say. Friendly staff however a little on the pricey side (reduction of prices or family/group offers would greatly increase the traffic)\n",

I cannot say more...you get to experience it and truly enjoy it.

The prices are reasonable and the food is to die for. I had dukbokki, kimchi Jeon, japchae, my husband had bulgogi and my friend had bibimbab. They were all delicious.

That's why when friends told us that there's another Korean restaurant in the capital, we searched for it and tried their signature dishes. We were not disappointed.\n",
      "The chicken was fantastic (there are 2 variants, one glazed with honey-barbecue sauce, the other just plain fried). It is basically similar to the dish from our favorite restaurant when we visited Seoul. Their japchae was also superb, and the kimbap as well. Their bulgogi was not exactly what I expected, but it was also generally good.They even serve few Japanese dishes, such as the miso soup which we ordered, which, I would say, was also tasty. The only thing I was disappointed a bit was that the side dishes (ban chan) was fewer compared to the previous Korean restaurant that we used to visit.\n",

In the past I've had the very tasty but spicy kimchi soup. (Spicy items are clearly marked on the menu.) The decor in this small restaurant is the very home-like, with lots of Korean knickknacks on display. The service is polite and efficient, and the prices are reasonable for Boulder.\n",

      "219 This place is a gem in Boulder, that few know about. This place has amazing food. I love their Mandoo soup. I always get that or their spicy beef soup. The kimchi is fantastic and the rice cooked to perfection. It is a family owned place (one of the few remaining in Boulder) where the husband serves the food and his wife cooks. He is the most pleasant person you will ever meet. He pulls out your chair for you when seating and always is attentive, and comes quickly if you need something. The restaurant is very cute and I admire the way he decorates. It is a random assortment of stuff from all over the world. The restaurant is always clean as if he just opened. The food smells delicious from the back. I have become a regular because of his food and the family’s kindness. I was having a rough day once and he brought a mochi dessert, on the house. If you are looking for quality Korean food at a reasonable price, this is the place to come. He is always so grateful to all who come to eat at his restaurant. This place, is by far my favorite place to eat in Boulder and I was born and raised here. He will go to any length to make sure you enjoy your meal. You can also do take out, but I highly recommend you stay and enjoy his hospitality. He has Korean and other Asian beers as well as sake of different types. This restaurant is sadly, tucked away behind a gas station so it is not visible from 28th street. But once you know where it is. It is very convenient with tons of parking available. Great place to eat alone, with family or friends. I always walk out with a smile on my face and a warmth in my belly due to his wife’s amazing cooking. To the customer who said that he charged them 20% tip without them knowing, then he did not read his receipt or the menu. So please disregard that review as, the owner is the farthest thing from a con man. As noted with the dessert he so generously gave to me. I have a feeling the customer leaving the one star review, had a party of six or more and it is common practice at restaurants, to place a 20% gratuity charge on this many at one table. So next time you want a really good place to eat with great service stop in here. It is well worth it. I guarantee you won’t be disappointed.\n"

I'm a tiny gal (4'11 and 96 lbs.) so this is more than enough to feed just myself. I had, however, been looking forward to trying the food here and had every intention of coming back and eating in another day when I had more of an appetite and could order a larger meal. Today I wanted to keep it simple. The owner, however, refused to even serve me unless I ordered an entree, which I simply wasn't interested in today. Not only that, but if I asked any questions about the items or dishes, not only did I not get much of a response, he just seemed irritated and responded in a very condescending manner.\n",

My bibimbap came with soup which wasn't hot (I was cold so really would have liked some hot soup) and quite bland. The bibimbap was adequate, it is kind of hard to mess up bibimbap. The spicy pork wasn't at all like any bulgogi we have had anywhere. The flavor wasn't there and the sauce was pasty tasting. The meal came with two small dishes of kimchi and pickle none of the other accompanyments that I normally see. I have spent much time in South Korea and have visited many Korean restaurants and this just wasn't it. l always get worried when a menu tries to do too much. This place had everything from noodles to sushi.\n",

It looked like the decor had changed so perhaps it is under new management but they had better review their changes or I'm pretty sure the will go out of business. My favorite dish is Bulgogi ( a korean BBQ beef). This restaurant used to have wonderful slices of this marinated beef. The dinner I got today arrived in a \"bento box\" which is a novel way to serve Asian food, however, the meat that came in the box was like leftover scraps. It was about four tablespoons of beef shreds, the biggest was about the size of a dime. The was about half a cup of rice, a teaspoonful of green vegetable and about a tablespoon of Kimchi. I had ordered a combo with dumplings ( gyoza) and there were four of those without the unique dipping sauce that usually accompanies it. $2.00 worth of food costed $10.50. I left there very diappointed and hungry! Sad to say, I will not be back!\n"

We were led to a dining room which looked like a dining hall. Not a tinge of class or history in there. Lunch was mediocre. We can get better food costing much less in restaurants in town.

As I traveled with my pregnant wife, I do not have issues on asking them for those prohibited foods for her like raw meat and those with caffeine. Regarding the food, the food is great and a bit different compared to the typical menu on restaurant, thus not sure if those are actually traditional. What I remember is that the servings are small but it is a lot, and they serve it so fast that we haven't finished yet with the first one but they are already serving the 3rd dish. But i think they are doing it so you will able to finish your meal before the show starts. About the show, same with the other reviews, recommendable and very traditional. I'm about to give a perfect rating for this review because of the show, but I feel that the price is very expensive that I expect more, maybe on the food, and no extra charges on the drinks.\n",

      "Overall, the meal, service and environment were wonderful. We arrived an hour late, and in the dark, but were welcomed with smiles from our hostess wearing a traditional Korean costume. We were lead through a large patio area where dances and other programs are conducted during the day. On the far side we ascended a set of rough stone steps and followed a cobble stone path to the building we would dine in. It was very impressive and the landscape lighting made it even more so.\n",
      "There are several separate buildings and if you sign up for a court cuisine dinner, you will be seated in your own dinning room. My daughter in law was concerned about my back and knees and asked that we be seated at a table rather than eating laying on the floor. When our hostess slid the door back of our dinning room the table was low, but the space under the table was hollow, allowing us to sit normally on padded seats that had backs. Very comfortable!\n",

Follow the link I provided above, click on ENGLISH, and look at Royal Cuisine to see the menu. All of it was delicious and the experience was fun. Our waitress, dressed in the traditional costume, spoke good English and was very helpful, attentive, and did not seem perturbed in the least we arrived an hour late.\n",

      "291 I've been here twice for lunch and ordered the bibimap both times which is a dish of rice, egg and vegetables and I believe meat if I'm not mistaken. It comes out sizzling sort of like fajitas and continues to cook in the clay pot which is a neat experience. It's also served with six different kinds of kimchi - which if you're not familiar with is a wonderful probiotic (gut health promoting) food and they were all fantastic. If you're familiar with latin food, you know that people get to fighting for the crispy rice in the bottom of the pot which is another highlight for me about the bibimap in the clay pot. My husband ordered the korean barbecue lunch and he really enjoyed it. The menu is full of dishes that seem similar to Chinese and Japanese stir fries as well as other seemingly uniquely Korean dishes. They also have tables where you can cook yourself in the center of the table.\n",

Not sure I will visit again but it was a nice experience.\n",

There is almost no waiting for to get the drink order going and food arrives very quickly. We recommend Korea House highly\n",

The young man who took care of us was wonderful, and since they weren't busy during that visit he took a few moments to answer some questions and correct my pronunciation.\n",

The service was superb, explaining any dish we weren't familiar with, and preparing the meat for us at the grill built into our table (which the kids loved). Apart from one appetizer that wasn't a big hit, all of the grilled meats and side dishes were excellent -- especially the Pork Bulgoi, which was labeled as spicy but was more of a pleasant tingle than really hot. Try this place if you like a Kobe-type Japanese restaurant -- much more flavorful cuisine here, and lower prices.\n",

They will ask you if you want a table with the stove grill or a standard table. We got the standard. I ordered a Gimbap for an appetizer. It is their take on a sushi roll. It was quite good. My wife had the Dolsot Bibimbap which is a veggie mix with Kimchi in a hot bowl. It also had an egg in it. I had the Sundubu Tziigae that is a hot pot with seafood and tofu. The taste was great but only 1 shrimp, 1 piece of squid and a tiny piece of probably octopus. They did refill the little dishes of kimchi items; service was very good. Overall I felt the quality and portions dropped. Korean dishes have been a favorite of ours for some time.\n"

The wait staff are always very cheerful and will explain in broken english what you want to order. Lovely people will serve the side dishes that are always fresh and always an incredible variety. A variety of Korean wines are offered that are served in a special sake cup. Reasonable prices and a great menu await you.

      "318 I'd been to Korea House a number of times in the 11 years I lived in the Orlando area. As with any Korean restaurant, they stick to real Korean food. There is no Americanization for any reason. If you don't like spicy food (and I don't mean spicy like Mexican food--that's mild, actually), you're probably better to go somewhere else, but there are a couple of options safe for non-Koreans.\n",

Korean BBQ is where you choose ingredients and cook it at your own table.\n",
      "\n",
      "The friends chose Gal Bi, Bul Gogi, and Pork Bul Gogi. I chose Dae Gu Jji Gae. They really, really liked the food, and being Caucasians, they don't have much experience with real Asian food. That's not a criticism--it's a fact, when places like P.F. Chang's represents itself as real Chinese food, what can you think?\n",
      "\n",
      "I was thrilled with my Dae Gu Jji Gae, but I really dislike the fish bones. I know what's going to happen. They don't remove the meat of the fish and put it in the pot to cook. They put the fish in the pot in pieces, including the bones. Cod is typically bony anyway, so it was a good-bad choice. I scooped a bit of the broth into another bowl and let the three of them try it. They were especially surprised when I told them that it was medium spicy for real Asian food.\n",

The kimchi soup with Tuna also very delicious but the Bibimbap a little-bit boring, too dry and no have a good taste of sesame paste as in Seoul or any city in Korea. The free appetizers is always generous portions like in many Korean style restaurant.

The four of us ordered four dishes, including two portions of Bulgogi, one fish soup and one noodle dish. The bulgogi cost 15€ per person, and the two portions we had were not even enough for one person to get full. There was barely anything in the fish soup, maybe four tiny pieces of fish?! The noodles were kinda OK, but did not have much flavor.\n",

The waiter was nice enough to tell us that we have to pay for extra kimchi. We were surprised to hear that because ALL the normal Korean restaurants offer side dishes for free, as a custom. The waiter went to ask the owner if we could get one for free. The owner came out from the back with such an arrogant attitude and told us we cannot get one for free. He said, if we want to have free side dishes, we should go to another place. We were totally shocked and could not believe it.

Squash is virtually non existent, golf is too expensive, but the Cinder Bar , oh the Cinder Bar. From the first moment I entered the doors of this small bar, I realised it had a huge heart. The guy who runs it tirelessly is Warren, a guy who remembers everyone’s names. The beer selection is amazing ... 12 on tap and at least 12 different bottled ales. The food is simple , but wholesome and tasty. Do not visit Songdo, without checking the Cinder Bar out.\n",

The burger, fish sandwich, fish & chips and fries are also favorites and give a variety of choices. Cost is very reasonable and appropriate.\n",

      "384 I had a little trouble finding the place but once I did my mouth was treated to the best fish and chips on the planet. Amazing! The beer was ice cold and served in good portions. Beer price was a little steep for me but I hit happy hour just right so I got a bit of a break. Totally satisfied. Pro tip if you are trying to find it: if you are on the street headed towards the bridge it's on the left side of the street before the bridge. It's in a bit of an alcove in a housing development. Set back off the road a tad. There's a sign the points left and I made the mistake of turning left before the sign and walking down the road. Unless they move the sign daily go past the sign and look left back where the little alcove of trees is and pull find it. Obviously if you are coming from the north across the bridge then it's the first set of building after the bridge on the right. The staff seek you out and welcome you which is nice. The fish and chips are phenomenal. Did I mention the fish and chips are great. You should definitely try the fish and chips.\n",

Primarily because it is one of the few true Expat Pubs in all of Incheon. The Kiwi, Warren, runs the Pub, and he was most hospitable. We settled in in the corner and the beers flowed freely. Even had time for some fish and chips: the fish was covered in golden batter, and the chips were delicious. The bar looks a little broken down (as was the area it was located in), but that added to the charm. If it was a rugby night, you could watch the TV, but it would've been a bit of a squeeze. There was also an upstairs, loft-style area.\n",

Warren and his new partner Sam have crafted this cozy establishment into a welcoming, warm and friendly place to have a nice meal and a brew or two. If you are in the mood, they also have a superior selection of single malt whiskeys. The prices are the best you will find in Incheon and the atmosphere is unmatched. The food is excellent as well. This is a family affair and Warren's wife is the establishment's cook. Of particular note is the new hamburger offered which is a new collaboration between Warren and \"The Flying Chef\".

Warren, the owner is kind, generous, respectful, and so are the rest of his crew. This is the first and only review I have written on my own for any travel site, and I will say this bar is a great place to make new and promising friends. You will get to meet some great people, many of whom are regulars there like myself... not saying I drink to often, but that I enjoyed hanging out with people from the bar. Not only is this bar a great meet up for old friends or new friends, but even other bar owners or restaurant come here to have a great time.\n",

When you come back, they remember your name and you can practically pick up your last conversation where you left off, even if its been awhile.

We took a taxi there and the taxi driver spoke to the owner for directions. I never expected the Irish Owner to speak perfect Korean, but apparently he does. And then, get this, he waited outside for our taxi to arrive. Could he be nicer? NO. Could he have made a more inviting place for visitors to grab a drink and have a chat? No. Warren, you are a rock star and your bar is deserving of every 5 star review it gets. Like we told you that night -- we want to franchise you!\n",

Who welcomed us with a smile and stories to go with. We managed to watch the NRL grand final with all having a great time and bringing more friends. The chicken wings to die for and the mini sliders that helps the famished traveller. Beers on tap are, Stella Artois and max but never leave the place without trying the famous cinders flaming shot with Warren(host) explaining the process. Most westerners drink here. Bar staff are well mannered, trained and speak English. This cozy, warm, fun and cool place with a selection of music that will tickle your ears and suitable for all ages and its home away from home. Cinder bar can order your cab for you and Warren is happy to escort you and being fluent in Korean able to show off his skills with local knowledge conversing with the driver able to direct the driver to your final destination. I have attached two photos with address and direction from the business card. Smoking & Drinking is permitted outside but be aware of noise as neighbours are living near by. I have had many happy memories there and have met people from around the world there. It's not a nite club but more like a pub. Somewhere to relax, unwind, have a chat, catch up, and have a beer. I have given a 5 star rating for excellence in every aspect of service from the moment you walk in. It's so hard to leave. To Warren and Staff, thank you for everything on behalf of Rocket, Thor aka Thoro aka Tom. Signing off,\n",

If you are feeling hungry they offer a couple options including some killer wings that come with a their own unique 'Cinder Sauce'. The real highlight of Cinder Bar is the service, the owner Warren is there every night and he is by far the best bartender in Incheon, he is warm friendly, and never let's an empty glass sit. Despite being born in New Zeeland he has lived in Korea long enough to speak fluent Korean. Because of this the atmosphere is unique it's not just a 'foreigner bar', every member of the Cinder crew can speak English and Korean so both locals and foreigner mingle in roughly equal proportions.\n",

Warren, the owner, gave our Uber driver directions on how to get to the bar (20 min from the airport). Kitchen open late for fish/chips and wings. Great alcohol selection (IPA imported from the U.S. on tap!) Great spot and will come back next time we have an overnight layover on Delta or Korean Air. Great mix of locals and expats.

      "550 I had a little trouble finding the place but once I did my mouth was treated to the best fish and chips on the planet. Amazing! The beer was ice cold and served in good portions. Beer price was a little steep for me but I hit happy hour just right so I got a bit of a break. Totally satisfied. Pro tip if you are trying to find it: if you are on the street headed towards the bridge it's on the left side of the street before the bridge. It's in a bit of an alcove in a housing development. Set back off the road a tad. There's a sign the points left and I made the mistake of turning left before the sign and walking down the road. Unless they move the sign daily go past the sign and look left back where the little alcove of trees is and pull find it. Obviously if you are coming from the north across the bridge then it's the first set of building after the bridge on the right. The staff seek you out and welcome you which is nice. The fish and chips are phenomenal. Did I mention the fish and chips are great. You should definitely try the fish and chips.\n",

      "553 I was on business in Korea, and my work colleagues took me out for a beer after work. Arrived at The Cinder Bar, which was my friend's regular. Primarily because it is one of the few true Expat Pubs in all of Incheon. The Kiwi, Warren, runs the Pub, and he was most hospitable. We settled in in the corner and the beers flowed freely. Even had time for some fish and chips: the fish was covered in golden batter, and the chips were delicious. The bar looks a little broken down (as was the area it was located in), but that added to the charm. If it was a rugby night, you could watch the TV, but it would've been a bit of a squeeze. There was also an upstairs, loft-style area.\n",

      "562 What a find the Cinder Bar is! Amid the high rise buildings stuffed with expensive restaurants, massage places, doctor's offices and just about everything else in this city there is a much better option. The Cinder Bar is located on the ground level at the last building on the left side of the road just before the bridge as you leave Incheon for the airport. Warren and his new partner Sam have crafted this cozy establishment into a welcoming, warm and friendly place to have a nice meal and a brew or two. If you are in the mood, they also have a superior selection of single malt whiskeys. The prices are the best you will find in Incheon and the atmosphere is unmatched. The food is excellent as well. This is a family affair and Warren's wife is the establishment's cook. Of particular note is the new hamburger offered which is a new collaboration between Warren and \"The Flying Chef\". It's easily the best burger in town. Should you decide to give the Cinder Bar a try I can guarantee you will have a new favorite hangout on your list.\n",

As a long time customer it is hard to be unbiased but the only advice I can offer is that whether you want to just go out and meet some new people, prop up on a bar stool and down beers or sit at table and have some cocktails.. Cinder is the only way to go.\n",

I was traveling alone and it didn't take very long before a group invited me to hang out with them at their table. Turns out most people had just met that night everyone was just mingling. I definitely recommend stopping in at Cinder Bar.\n",

No pizza (reported incorrectly here) but wings, fries, shrimp, fish & chips, & a burger. Friendly staff. Well done & highly recommend!\n",

      "612 After trying to find a bar that suited our needs, we were directed to Cinder bar. We were welcomed by friendly staff and the host with the most Warren Kidd from NZ. Who welcomed us with a smile and stories to go with. We managed to watch the NRL grand final with all having a great time and bringing more friends. The chicken wings to die for and the mini sliders that helps the famished traveller. Beers on tap are, Stella Artois and max but never leave the place without trying the famous cinders flaming shot with Warren(host) explaining the process. Most westerners drink here. Bar staff are well mannered, trained and speak English. This cozy, warm, fun and cool place with a selection of music that will tickle your ears and suitable for all ages and its home away from home. Cinder bar can order your cab for you and Warren is happy to escort you and being fluent in Korean able to show off his skills with local knowledge conversing with the driver able to direct the driver to your final destination. I have attached two photos with address and direction from the business card. Smoking & Drinking is permitted outside but be aware of noise as neighbours are living near by. I have had many happy memories there and have met people from around the world there. It's not a nite club but more like a pub. Somewhere to relax, unwind, have a chat, catch up, and have a beer. I have given a 5 star rating for excellence in every aspect of service from the moment you walk in. It's so hard to leave. To Warren and Staff, thank you for everything on behalf of Rocket, Thor aka Thoro aka Tom. Signing off,\n",

I was studying abroad in Songdo for about a year, and I can easily say that going to The Cinder Bar made me feel right at home and also very welcomed in a country/place that I was new to. Warren is not only kind, but also innovative. The food is delicious. I can't get enough of the fry dip! And he always had a new drink recommendation for me and my friends that we always loved! He is always reaching higher and making The Cinder Bar a fun, exciting, and comfortable place to meet up with friends and enjoy the night. Highly Recommend! Definitely swing by!\n",

The interesting range of drinks available traverse the globe too, from serving Korea's Maxx, new Zealand beers and decent Scotch whiskey to Manhattans and Warrens' signature cocktails... and now you can enjoy tasty food there too. Would I recommend a visit? Definitely, from meeting people in the community and watching a rugby match to having a quiet drink, this bar has it all... and the playlist pleases too! Probably why it's been our local for over a year.\n",

If you are feeling hungry they offer a couple options including some killer wings that come with a their own unique 'Cinder Sauce'. The real highlight of Cinder Bar is the service, the owner Warren is there every night and he is by far the best bartender in Incheon, he is warm friendly, and never let's an empty glass sit. Despite being born in New Zeeland he has lived in Korea long enough to speak fluent Korean. Because of this the atmosphere is unique it's not just a 'foreigner bar', every member of the Cinder crew can speak English and Korean so both locals and foreigner mingle in roughly equal proportions.\n",

The lettuce, sauces and sides were topped up for free. The service was excellent with frequent grill changes and the food compared favourably to bbq I have eaten in South Korea. My partner very much enjoyed his first Korean bbq and would come again. I was initially a bit apprehensive as it was empty (at 5pm) and doesn't have a great exterior but I am glad we came in. Highly recommended, I just wish we'd had space for the kimchi pancake!\n",

The first time in the UK that I've tasted kimchi which actually had some kick to it. The pudding menu is very limited but some really unusual flavours - black sesame or red bean ice cream anyone? However some of the meat wasn't well cut & was therefore awkward on the barbeque and the overall value of the barbeque was poorer tan some I've had. Dishes arrived a little haphazardly and one a couple of times things were forgotten though came quickly after a prompt. Overall a pleasant evening but wouldn't go out of my way to come here again when there is so much other choice in the city.\n",

This was brilliant we got a mixed meat platter for £20.00 each we received free top up sides and beer each.the meat was lovely and it was a really nice way to eat. Interestingly the more you ate the better it became and the more you wanted to keep eating. Would highly recommend as great value for money, very filling and a really nice experience.\n",

      "675 I've had Korean BBQ before. Its not really my thing since I can cook reasonably well at home so there's little fun in doing this in a restaurant. However my teenage daughters fondness for K-Pop made her ask to go here. We went. Table was OK. Place was light and airy. We saw about twelve ingredients on display for the customers to add to their meals. Soy and chili, coriander, spring onions, oyster sauce, two red bean sauces and so on. Nothing really exotic and nothin particularly Korean. Supermarkets have most of these ingredients nowadays. We ordered tempura starters and although huge and expensive for starters they weren't awfully good. Tempura batter was darker, oilier and heavier than the best I've had. Particularly for the prawns. My veg tempura was a little better but still not great. We ordered beef mains. Meagre portions considering other places in Edinburgh offer more variety. We got three bowls of lukewarm sticky rice which was more \"badly made\" than actually sticky. I can make better at home and I expect better from restaurants. I won't come here again. The Korean beer we wanted was out of stock. Our starters arrived several minutes apart and the nice waiting staff told me the kitchen was busy. There was about ten more diners in the place than we three. We had pints of Diet Coke each. Bill was pricey for what we received although average for the typical fare. Sadly this place was below par.\n",

Great food and fairly inexpensive. The staff were also very friendly and didn't give me too many bad looks for my inability to use chopsticks!\n"

      "677 Great little restaurant. Cook your own bbq meat which would be fun for a group. Lots of other dishes available. Fresh and tasty. Ask if you don’t want it too spicy or ask for extra if you like it a little hotter. Free sides dishes. Good Korean tea snd the seafood pancake delicious. Cash only. Will make a return visit. Opening offer 10% off the bill. Gunbae.\n",

The side dishes were delicious too, especially the salad and the marinated beansprouts, and the sauce was so tasty. We ordered rice as well, but it really wasn't necessary as the set itself is a very generous portion for 2 hungry full-grown men! I have, sadly, never been to Korea, but I have eaten at barbecue restaurants in the Korean district of Tokyo and this competes with the best of them. The staff were very attentive and friendly, and keen to recommend delicious, authentic combinations of meat and side dishes. All this for a very reasonable price - we'll definitely be back!\n",

      "We just randomly walked in, seeing many people there so we really thought this should be a good place for food. However, the food there made us soooo disappointed. We ordered four dishes and none of them tasted okay. The BBQ source was so weird and the beef was not fresh at all! As for the beef soup, I would say they destroyed every thing. It was so slight and there was not enough ingredients inside. All in all, I don’t recommend it. This restaurant is unqualified.\n",

      "Service was very mixed, girl waitress was excellent, organised and efficient, but the other staff not quite so, some were just lazy. Asked to get table cleared after main course, as they left it on table for 20 mins, even though the restaurant was quieter. The youngest staff cleared 1/4 of table, after requested, then proceeded to stand around and do nothing for next 10 mins. Eventually got table cleared, including glasses with wine remaining in them, after requesting again. Awful attention to guests.\n",
      "Food was a different case. BBQ chicken was a generous portion, BBQ Prawns not so, only 6 medium prawns for the money. Stir-Fry was generous portion and tasty.\n",

      "693 Three of us went for dinner, having the kimchi pancake (very generous with the kimchi, and not too spicy if that’s something you’re worried about), the BBQ Set D and the Naengmyun (Cold noodles in a vinegar broth). The pancake was delicious and probably the best I have had outside of Korea! And the set includes a variety of 5 cuts of meat (the pork neck slice is especially tender and delicious) and 2 beers of your choice, this was an extremely generous portion and undoubtedly worth the price - a great option if you’re new to KBBQ and aren’t sure what cuts to order. The set also comes with all you need for Ssam (lettuce wraps) and the side dishes are also of a great quality (and are refilled for free if you ask). The naengmyun is also probably the best I’ve ever had, I highly recommend!! The service was great - very attentive and friendly, explaining how to use the bbq and changing out the grill halfway through to a cleaner one (something I was very impressed by, as many Korean restaurants don’t do that in the U.K). Overall I was extremely impressed, and would even consider it the best Korean restaurant I’ve been to outside of Korea!\n",

We went for the the BBQ set meal D for 2 which came with to beers and prices at £38:80 was great value for what was served up. The only thing that we made a mistake on was not ordering side dishes of rice/noodles as wasn’t sure what the set meal came with..lol the Wee bbq plate in the middle of the table was quick to heat up and did not make the dining area to hot to enjoy your meal. The marinaded beef slice was outstanding and watch out for the chicken as it’s bloody spicy (well for my mouth anyway..lol) this restaurant is very busy and we were lucky to get a table for 2 not long after opening time so I would suggest phoning to make a reservation to make sure you’re not disappointed..\n",

You have a heating plate built into the center of each table, on which you \"barbecue\" your own food (meat, prawns, etc.), or you can order one of the prepared stir-fried dishes. One of us had the BBQ, and the other got stir-fried. We both extremely enjoyed our meals. Whether you have stir-fried or BBQ, the \"Korean way\" of eating it is by placing some of your cooked meal on a lettuce leaf, adding some of the condiments they bring you (spicy radish/bean sprouts/sauce), rolling it up, and eating the roll. Very tasty, and a fun/interesting way to eat, to boot! The prices were also quite reasonable. Highly recommended!\n",

The restaurant itself is not too big, but looks cozy. We tried 2 different kind of ramens, some kimchi, and korean green tea latte. The drink was amazing, the food even better! Their tempura is so tasty, I keep telling my man to go back to get more.\n",

The waiters were so friendly and helpful showing us how to use the BBQ and talking us through all the pickles and seasoning. The food was absolutely delicious and the Korean Beer was good too. At the end the staff called us a taxi - they couldn’t do enough to help. The only thing to note is that it was cash only so make sure you take enough cash with you but definitely go! Also it really would be hard for vegetarians.\n",

      "735 My friends and I are regulars at KBBQ and although their normal dishes are very good, we love the Korean barbeque the most. It's super fun to cook the meat yourself, although if you're nervous the staff will jump in to help, or cook it for you if you prefer. Even as a group of students we find we can all leave full and happy for around £10-20 per person depending on how greedy we are about the meat selection! A great place to spend some quality time with friends or family and enjoy crazy tasty food all the while.\n"

The menu is varied - for both carnivores and vegetarian options. We tried the barbeque at the table - and this added to the experience as well as the flavor- with staff attentive and helpful, to make sure the food was prepared properly- cooked well but not singed and smokey. Marinades flavoursome with just the right amount of bite and side veg dishes crispy and tastey. We had dumplings and seaweed salad to start. Finished with black sesame ice cream I have travelled in Asia and experienced authentic local dishes and this was on par.\n",

We'd never been to a Korean bbq before so didn't know what to expect, but what a great experience it was and we had such a great time. we ordered beef slices, king prawns, seaweed, two portions of rice and two grape juices; all of this coming with free sides and sauces. The beef and prawns were beautifully marinated and the staff was very helpful in showing us how to cook as it was our first time. The rice was excellent and the seaweed was as well (despite not liking it much myself). Would highly recommend getting the grape juice as well if you're looking for something non-alcoholic, tasted great and even had little grapes inside the can which added to the experience of a different culture. Overall, I must say that this place is a true wonder, with a great variety of food, friendly staff and excellent little details such as the metal chopsticks and drinks being served in their original can/bottle covered in Korean/Japanese writing; and for a very filling meal we only spent £30.\n",

Finally we got our table and happily ordered beef bbq set for two. Unfortunately, it doesn’t come with lots of little additional dishes as in South Korea does, but one has to order for extra fee. Our bulgogi tasted well, but it wasn’t that authentic though. For me the highlight was kimchi, that tasted very different from packaged ones. Waiters were quick and polite, thumbs up for them. Also it felt a bit expensive for what you get. Oh, and bare in mind your clothes will be soaked with smelly smoke for days, as everyone is grilling it’s own meat and there are no smoke extractors, unfortunately.\n",

I had to order white rice as it doesn't come with the order, which from other places I've been to globally that was weird. My water glass came out with food on it, which was gross, but the server replaced it. We asked for a pitcher of water, but that never came. When it came time to pay it was hard to get a server and the restaurant at this point was not full.

After a rough day of pulling suitcases up and down hills to get to our hotel, we had a delicious meal at this place. Food tasted fresh, staff was friendly and place was very clean. The only down side to this place and why I gave 4/5 instead of 5/5 is because they only took cash on the day we went. Not sure if this is a usual thing but they at least knew where the closest ATM machine was. Overall great place would definitely recommend it and would go back if we ever returned.\n"

The seafood pancake was nothing special, but it was nice and tasty, more pancake flavour than seafood, but it was nice overall. The chicken gyoja were really nice, the Kimchi side is something you have to try at least once, and it was something spicy, crunchy, fresh and with a lot of flavour, even though is a side measure, it is quite a nice portion, so keep in mind if you just want to try it. And the best for us was the Mo Dum Gu (we got the Assorted meat bbq menu that includes salads), it comes with 2 sauces, one spicy and delicious and another of sesame that it was also really good, also comes with lettuce to make wraps (and when we ran out of lettuce they brought us more without charging for it), it also comes with some salads to fill your wraps or eat them alone, delicious, spicy and tasty. And the meat selection is top notch, everything was really nice but our favourites were the Pork neck slice and the Darkgalbi, both of them marinated. It includes also 2 beers or 2 soft drinks, but as we were ordering a bottle of wine, Pinot Grigio Veneto, we didn't ordered them.

And suddenly come other staff that look like it is the manager and he yell to us that we cannot sit there because there is 2 stove in the table, and move as rudely to table that have one stove in the back. And it is continue when we want to choose the menu, that staff tell we must have same menu because the stove is just one and menu cannot be mixed eventhough we wanted to have different menu and we forbidden to move back to that table. So, we comprise and got same menu because we already hungry. Later on, when we paid the bill that rude staff is in the cashier and give the change without saying anything.

The other 3 who were not into spicy food had to order 3 servings of the Chicken Bulgogi (which was sweet but also slightly spicy) and separate orders of rice. I really enjoyed the Chicken Bulgogi and even the people in the spicy table liked it. The rice was sticky and delicious too.

I think cheese is the best combination with spicy Stir-fried Chicken. Lastly, when I am done eating, we can add fried rice. I think this steps are best step for eating spicy Stir-fried Chicken. Therefore, if you have some chance for try it, you can order this menu. In addition, price is not really expensive.\n"

We next ordered the mixed honey and marinated galbi with a cheese river separating the two meats. Again very good. You may need to double check that the meat is cooked through as a few pieces needed to be cooked a bit longer. It wasn’t a problem as you just moved it to the side to cook longer.

This guy, whom i assume is the Supervisor, cause he was in a different uniform, came up to our table aggressively and raised his voice saying, 'Order NOW, YOU SIT HERE SO LONG'. I explained, my wife is in the toilet, dont worry once shes out we will order'. He shouts, 'NO ORDER NOW' and flings the menu at my 64 year old dad.\n",

But all are chicken menu, and the problem is if we are on the same table, we have to choice 1 menu, maybe because they cook on our table. If you are 3 or 4 people. Then you have to choose one. As a traveler we prefer to try several different foods instead of one choice. Taste is not bad, maybe chicken is not my favorite.\n",

For Koreans it is quite trivial. \"Prepared\" is probably a strong word. Rather mixed and heated. This allows you to feel involved in the process. The food itself is ordinary, nothing supernatural. I'd define as Korean fastfood. So the prices are quite humane.\n"

She even gave us looks while we were ordering because she had a difficult time understanding. Because she had a difficult time understanding, she placed the wrong order without even checking with us and then telling us that we can't change it because it has already been placed. After that, she did not try to check in with us and another server had to help us with the food. We never saw the waitress again during our meal. The table next to us were also tourists and we could tell they had some confusion with what they ordered and their waiter was impatient with them and rudely asked a server to deal with them. I would think because this location is in a tourist district that they would cater to tourists but they really fail with that.

Our food came shortly and we chatted while waiting for the chicken to be cooked all the way. I thought the food was just average and wasn't spicy enough but my friend who never had Dakgalbi before loved it. We loved dipping our chicken in cheese and the fried rice they made for us at the end. I'm glad my friend enjoyed her meal but I probably won't visit on my own.\n"

We choose their signature dish of chicken and cabbage mixed with red sauce and rice which was good. Our waiter brought the ingredients and cooked them. At first we thought it was because we were foreigners, but then we noticed that other waiters were doing the same at other customers' table.
