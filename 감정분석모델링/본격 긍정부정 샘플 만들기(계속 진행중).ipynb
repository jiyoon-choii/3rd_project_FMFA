      "I'm Korean so I'm fussy about Korean food. \n",
      "The banchan (small side dishes) are average. They could be fresher. Kimchi is below average.  Thickly grated cabbage with creamy dressing - not Korean. \n",
      "Bibimbap is good and tasty but for $13 it's a small portion.  Bulgogi (bbq beef) is too sweet.  \n",
      "They use sugar very heavily here. Caters to non -asian palates perhaps.  \n",
      "Fried chicken is good. Got the plain with sauce on the side. The sauce is like syrup.  \n",
      "Very nice touch of providing a carafe of cold water at the table as soon as you sit - Appreciated. Not my fave Korean in Mtl but not bad.\n",

      "4 MUST TRY!!! Well worth the travel. In a vibrant and bustling city, this little restaurant is definitely a gem to mine. Each and every time, we have yet to be disappointed. Service is fast and straight to the point, food is uncomplicated yet leave a lasting impression that leave us wanting more. This is simplicity at its best. I've only ever came back for one thing - their original fried chicken is the best of its kind, an experience I've yet to match anywhere else I've dined before.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their fried chicken is perfection. The meat is perfectly seasoned to the bones, skin so light and flakey yet sported a wicked crisp. The meat is impeccably tender and moist; even the oh-so-often undesirable white meat was delightful enjoyed. Price, quality, and taste unmatched by none. We ordered 2 whole chicken for 4 diners, which left us at a good spot. There are a variety of different dipping sauces at a charge (we all favoured the spicy sweet sauce and the soy garlic).   \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, I would make the drive from Toronto to Montreal again, just for another order of this. Overall, the best fried chicken hands down, bar-none. MUST TRY!!!\n",

      "5 We were famished after a busy day so we decided to check out a Korean place, Mon Ami, for a late night dinner. It's BYOB! They have two other locations (another on Somerled and other on Sherbrooke). Interesting that the other Somerled location does Korean BBQ. \n",
      "\n",
      "We dropped in on a Friday evening (around 9:00pm). The place wasn't too busy so we were able to grab seats right away. There's three tables on their patio that looked like a perfect spot outside. \n",
      "\n",
      "The menu is split into KFC (three kinds), meals/soup/noodles, lunch and dessert. \n",
      "\n",
      "- Banchan - we got five side dishes; kimchi, coleslaw, seaweed salad, pickled radish and daikon. Seaweed salad was my favourite. \n",
      "- Kimbap (#41) ($6.99) - Korean style sushi. Decent. \n",
      "- Japchae (#52) ($9.99) - this was a small portion of noodles.\n",
      "- Fried chicken (#1) ($12.49 half) - there were 5 pieces of KFC in our basket. Lightly fried, not greasy and moist, tender chicken. Good but it was a bit plain; I'd get it with a sauce next time. \n",
      "- Bulgogi (#22) ($15.99) - comes with a side of rice. The beef was flavourful and oh so tender. \n",
      "- Bulgogi dolsot bibimbap (#23) ($12.99) - we got the fried egg on the side. The hot stone bibimbap was great. Nice and crispy rice. Add the gojumchang to taste. \n",
      "- Spicy pork dolsot bibimbap (#23) ($11.99) - first one was so good we ordered another one with spicy pork.\n",

      "\n",
      "They begin with a small plate of complementary appetizers (seaweed salad, kimchi and picked cabbage). Our fried chicken and vegetable dumplings arrived at this time as well. As I said, very hot and flavourful! We then shared the bbq beef and stir fried pork. These were my favourite dishes and came with rice. We also had the ramen and hot pot bulgogi soup which had great flavour but were not so filling and I was glad to have ordered the appetizers. Although our food didn't all arrive at the table at the same time, it was fresh and hot when it did.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also still don't know if this restaurant is byob or not, it was not obvious and I forgot to ask while we were there.\n",

      "I went in summer time, it is good to have an open window concept. But it was a bit hot in a hot day to eat spicy Korean food. I suggest to not being cheap in electricity bill and provide a comfortable environment for customer to eat. \n",
      "\n",
      "Aside from fried chicken, the other dishes are decent. Nothing special, other Korean place has more favorable sane dishes. But the fried chicken is still worth to go for!\n",

      "8 This is a wonderful place to enjoy hot dogs. I've been to the one on fort apache and the is one is like a upgrade. Not only did they only have hot dogs but waffles and chicken wings. Their chicken wings were by far the best I've tasted perfectly seasoned and with 2 specialty sauce that are so unique taste. Now that this one is open a lot closer than the other one they will be expecting a lot of visits from me.\n"

I asked them to put my spring rolls in a separate box so they don't get sauce on them, he said no threw it In the same plate and then poured sauce on it. They have horrible customer service and bad food preparation practices, if I knew somebody in the health service industry I would report this place immediately. The owners carelessness had reached new heights. The food now comes burnt and it definitely doesn't feel clean. He used the same tongs for raw, cooked meat, then used it on the French fries.\n",

Then because the sandwich was too big he used the same tongues he used for raw and cooked meats to smush my burnt bun down to make it fit.\n",
      "Never coming back again. The service is horrible and the meat is not good at all.   There are only 2 waitress total for the whole restaurant on a Saturday.  We sat here for 15 mins before she came to get our order.   Also you can only order 2 dishes at a time with all you can eat.  With the super slow and unfriendly service.  This has been a fairly painful meal for us.   And the food really isn't good. The meat was so sweet and the side dishes were not yummy at all.  Btw. Only 3 side dishes serve here.  At Goong, I believe they serve 10 side dishes.  Even they are not all you can eat.  At the end the bill was cheaper and the meat quality is way better.  Very disappointed with honey pig today.  The one in Chinatown was way better\n",
      "The food there was average ,but the Service was lacking.  The two middle aged Korean servers had an aloof attitude and they were completely inattentive to our dining needs.  It was our third time dining at this location, we live nearby in seven hills. One of the severs also spilled water on my mom's pants as she cleared the table. We are not the type of people who like to complain, but I think the place needs better management cuz service was horrible!  Overpriced for the competition on eastern ave in Henderson, this place won't last.\n",
      "Worst korean bbq I've been to in awhile! Service was a joke. Asking for side dishes were like a burden to the workers. Fried rice was horrible. This place is giving korean bbq a bad name! Don't go to this location! If you're craving honey pig just go to the original location in Chinatown on decatur. Better service & food!\n",
      "We were so happy when we passed by this place.. and even though we bought our groceries, we just had to eat here. We got black bean noodle and fried pork (tangsuyuk). Not only did our food take awhile (it wasn't busy and they had so many workers in the back).. both items were warm/cold. The fried pork was just horrible. I've had really good tangsuyuk in California and this thing was nothing like it. It was cold, oily and rubbery.and if you're wondering we had the sauce in the side so the breading wouldn't get soggy but it didn't even matter the pork itself tasted like it was fried and just sat on the side some where.. oh and the portion size is extremely small if you have the sauce in the side..I don't know why that is but my husband and I looked at each other thinking it was a kids meal. I mean for the price, let's not be to stingy please!!!! Noodles were better but it was cold and extremely oily. I would say it had more flavor than other jajangmyun places I ate in AZ but it was still lacking. So why the 1 star? Well, after telling the staff at the cash register both the Korean lady and the Hispanic girl was really rude and not helpful what so ever..didn't bother to make it right (even offering to heat up my food would've been great) they just told me that's how it is!!! Really?!? Yup! that's what customers like to hear...not!!! ���\n",
      "The meet was horrible and me and my girlfriend order at the same plate and the taste was different?\n",
      "The lady in the counter had attitude when we asked for refill for lemonade. If we had to pay more for refill, I had no problems doing so... but she did not ask for more money.... just rolled her eyes and had attitude and waved her hand said she was busy and told me to waited there... horrible customer service.\n",
      "Two stars seem about right for Bryan's BBQ. The side dishes are forgettable, the meat is decent quality, but the place needs some work. As we were eating, some big black blob fell from inside the vent onto our grill. Yuck. We guessed it was the grease build up but still, not good at all. My friends came here because they wanted to try all the meat (they have some weird rules) and it became a game for gluttony, trying to eat everything to eat all the meat. I didn't experience the horrible service that many people rant about here though, must've been a good day.\n",
      "The food was mediocre at best. But the service was horrible. I should have questioned the restaurant when I walked in during the evening and it was nearly empty...\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Please go elsewhere to eat in the area.\n",
      "I heard that this was suppose to be like my all time favorite restaurant which is Korea house located on e32 and superior.  Heard that they bought it. What a let down. I was expecting the same service as korea house. Didnt get that. Ordered by favorite dish. Japchea and it didnt even taste like it. On too of that at korea house they give u apps first. We got nothing here but bad food and horrible service by a server/ bartender that did not obviously want to be there. Oh well. Very disappointed. I was happy cause I live by this place. Didnt have to drive to the east side. Figured same food was right here. Boy was a wrong ill just stay at korea house\n",
      "Always disappointed in this place. It's a shame since we live so close!!! The food is just ok and the service at the bar is typically horrible and inattentive. The last time I was there mid-day I am pretty sure the owner was waiting on us at the bar which was awkward since her hair was a mess like she rolled out of bed and came into work. It seemed like right as we came in the bartender left and that's why she waited on us. I can't really get that image out of my head whenever I think of this place. I really wish that I liked this place more.\n",
      "the food here is great..but the reason why im giving this place 2 stars is because of the service and attitude of the staff (except a new worker who was very nice). it seems the other staff are only polite to other koreans and racist to everyone else. do not deal with the woman who i hope isn't the owner. she has no idea how to treat customers and is extremely rude, she was also treating the new employee quite horrible in front of patrons (if they're overwhelmed by the amount of customers they should hire more workers). if you're not korean i would suggest getting take out and avoiding the bad attitudes of the staff, they might ruin your experience.\n",
      "I came here upon the recommendation of a friend who mentioned that Omma is the best kept secret of the Mile End...and he was right! This used to be my favorite Korean spot because the food and service was pretty good, but my last visit left a pretty sour note. If you can, get reservations ahead of time because it gets pretty packed (it's also a very small place.)\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Good: The atmosphere is very intimate during the evenings and cozy during the summertime on the terrace. The food is very good and has never disappointed. Sizzling hot and always fresh, but my favorite is their homemade kimchi. It was so good, I ordered a second bowl.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Bad: I find the prices tend to be a bit high, but that's not going to stop me from eating what I enjoy. However, during my last visit, we had such horrible and slow service, I am not sure how I feel about coming back again. The waiter took over 20 minutes to take our order and barely ever came to check out is. Water was barely refilled and we had to wait even longer to get our bill. We became so impatient that we just cancelled the rest of the order after 3 of our plates arrived and went elsewhere instead.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Bottom line: Give me a year to cool off from this episode of awful service and I would consider going back because I honestly do enjoy their food.\n",
      "Was not very happy with my experience here at all. The service was horrible, we received no drink refills the entire visit. There was one server for the entire restaurant so service was insanely slow. We asked for forks twice and never received them during the visit. The grill/bbq went out half way through cooking the pork, we were able to finally get the attention of the server and tell her we needed it to be lit again... Then waited 15+ minutes with the half raw pork just sitting there before the waitress bought a lighter over and lit the BBQ again. This meant that 2 of us had food and were pretty much finished eating before the 3rd of us even got to cook his food. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The food was not good enough to excuse the long frustrating meal. This will be the last time we go here.\n",
      "I love Korean food....but I honestly don't think I can ever come back here again. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "First, the restaurant is so dark that I could barely see the menu. The tables are so greasy to the point that I didn't even want to put my arms on it. I thought to myself that it is normal since the tables have BBQ grills on them. As long as the food is good, it doesn't matter to me. We orderd a Kalbai and bulgogi (BBQ ribs and beef) so that we would cook it ourselves. We also ordered a side of dumplings. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When the waitress started up thr grill, i immediately notice that the top of the grill was bend and broken (Really?). Dumplings were completely burnt. Kalbai and Bulgogi were so oily that I could barely finish them. They do offer many different types of kimchi. However, half of them were so soar that we could even eat them. To make our experience here even worse was the horrible ventilation system. The idiots behind us clearly didn't know how to cook their own food. They messed it up so bad that it smoked up the entire place. Their vent just didn't do a good job of taking care of situation such as this. I basically walked out of that place smelling like BBQ for hours!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The only reason I still give this place a 2 star is because of the waitress. Service wasn't great but that was only because the restaurant is short staff. Not her fault at all. I saw the owners walking around doing their own thing, but would not lift a finger to help her. She was the only waitress sitting the guests, cleaning tables, serving food, and checking people out. That is just wrong!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ill never come back here again\n",
      "Typical Korean BBQ , it's about time Charlotte got one . I think it's personally overpriced for the quality of meat you get and the types of bonchon but I'm use to this type of food so I'm being more strict , and eat Korean bbq alot.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I gave it 4 stars bc the service was great and fast, they had many workers attending to the tables . If you have kids, come during the day bc I can easily see this being a crowded spot for adults at night. Parking is horrible. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Only suggestions I would make is explain the sauces and bonchon to those that arent familiar with Korean bbq in detail. Make your cheese corn larger with better cheese.  Peel the shrimp and add salt and pepper, get some regular soy sauce on the table for kids .\n",
      "The food is good but the wait is horrible. Time after time, we would usually wait around 30-60 minutes for the food to come out. Finally, we had it and left because they forgot our order from waiting for 1 hour. The wait isn't worth the food unless you have a lot of time. They only had 2 staff working and the waiter was all flustered from the chaos. It just ruined our day.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To sum up the experience, the service is horrible but its not the waiters fault, its the manager/boss. The food is okay but has been going downhill since opening.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I used to love this restaurant but am now disappointed.\n",
      "Worst food and worst service ever (the Christie Limganae). As a korean i hate to write bad review on a korean restaurant but they are the worst in toronto. Used to be good until last year but they started putting in junks in the food like colouring and msgs to make the horrible soups look genuine. Found hair in food and they just snatched the food and didnt even apologize. I wouldnt go there to try korean food. Actually i wouldnt go there for anything if youre half sane.\n",
      "not the best Korean food on the planet. however, in the paper- they gave this place a 4 star rating. eeeks. c'mon, if you're going to review a Korean restaurant... send a Korean over there to see if it's authentic and tasty enough. i was pretty disappointed- and the service was horrible. baaaa\n",

      "I had arrived embarrassingly late for my own hosted event.  Everybody was seated in a nice cluster near the front with tables put together so we had one long table for our large group.  The place is sort of tight and it's kind of impressive they are able to accommodate a party of our size with a fair bit of notice but it was greatly appreciated.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "What was odd and unfortunately WAY off was the service.  I get that this place is busy and that Tuesdays are their special night (1/2 price wings) but I have to say there are some things that just made me think of how things could of been better because they were or became that bad.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      " As I said I arrived last.  The entire table as far as I knew did not order, but the other end did however and they had food before our end even had a chance to ask for anything really.  I had ordered a drink that never came.  I had to ask our server again for it and it finally came then.  My end of the table finally got around to ordering and we were told they COULD NOT do separate bills but they could charge by 4's per table.  Technically I was at my own table of 4 by myself being as I was last and at the end.  \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I ended up being included with the 4 besides me not really a big deal but my beer ended up on a table at the other end?  Billing was a disaster, just a complete disaster which could have been avoided if they bothered to bill everybody individually.  We were 12 people, not 15 as I had made the reservation for so 12 is not 50 individual bills.  I thought their unwillingness to give separate bills only added the frustration and confusion as to who ordered what and why was this on that bill for that table.  DISASTER.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The menu is the menu sure.  Wings are the special on Tuesday no problem.  The one stipulation which I completely do not understand is that you can order wings any way EXCEPT garlic soy.  I also experienced this phenomenon at Home of Hot Taste.  Is the secret ingredient for garlic soy platinum and diamonds and I just don't know it?  Why and by what logic can you order wings in ANY other flavor EXCEPT garlic soy which was what I was looking forward to? It made no sense but it was explicitly on the menu.  It's like trying to argue balls and strikes, you just can't do that.\r\n",

      "Because of previous bad experiences of KFC in Toronto I've now come to the conclusion that if I want my chicken crispy and to remain crispy that I will have to ask for all my sauces on the side.  I am willing to do this.  I've now had KFC in 4 different cities in North America, 5 if you count Mississauga as not Toronto (Pittsburgh, NYC, Chicago and Toronto) and by far the 2 places I went to in NYC and Chicago each particularly know how to keep chicken crispy/crunchy while juicy on the inside and NOT dripping wet.  I'm speaking of Crisp in Chicago and Turntable in NYC.  All the others have been IMO way too wet and not crispy/crunchy because the sauce they drown the wings in makes them lose that.  I had almost felt like a diva asking for the sauce on the side but I had no choice after my last TO KFC experience had me picking up wings only to have them stream sauce like a honey pot dipper.  \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Chicken wings:  GOOD but not special and 7 or so small wings with fries is regularly 13 bucks?  Regular price it's not a great deal.  Tuesday 1/2 price so basically 2 pounds (maybe about 14 to 16 wings about 13 bucks) for that price is not so bad.  I had a pint of Sapporo and it was 6.50.  Basically I left 25 bucks for my food and single drink.  I would have left 15% tip but the service was not good.  \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To make things worse and this topped it all off besides getting all of our bills wrong was NOBODY had asked for the bills and all of the bills came to the table.  Is this their way of saying LEAVE?  I've never been given the bill without asking if we wanted anything else.  I was going to have another beer but I guess not as it seems they wanted us to pay.  The thing is we didn't leave right away.  The Jays game was on the tv and we were watching.  I didn't really feel they wanted us to order more because they gave us (all tables) their bills which were a jumbled mess that had to be asked to be fixed several times.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As people started to leave and our table began to thin out the remaining for asked to move to another table to consolidate so others could sit down.  I didn't see anybody waiting for tables but that's fair.  That table was eventually filled too which is cool.  \r\n",

      "Pros:\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Cons:\r\n",
      "The food quality is just decent. When it comes to the bbq or meat related dish, I think they use the same sauce base. We ordered two different pork dishes but they basically tasted the same cause the base sauce is same. \r\n",

      "They dont really have much drink option other than soda.\n",
      "If all you care about is taste, this place is good.\r\n",
      "But I can't get over my horrible experience last time. My boyfriend and I ordered one dish each. I got my dish kimchi stew about 15 mins later. And we kept waiting and waiting for his food to arrive - which was bulgogi btw. When I saw the huge group who arrive much later than us getting their food, I had already finished my food. \r\n",
      "I asked the waiter about it and he told me we didn't order the other dish! That really pissed me off. I distinctly remembered ordering his because my bf fumbled on saying bulgogi and I corrected it. That shameless man cannot get 2 orders right and tried to act like he did nothing wrong...AND made us wait another 20 mins before it came. \r\n",
      "Zero apologies and absolutely horrible attitude.\n",
      "I came into the restaurant two days ago, a Friday night. The line was long so we thought we would get an appetizer. The waitress said the potstickers we were looking at were amazing.\r\n",
      "We ordered the potstickers and they looked nothing like the menu! They came out white, they looked boiled and not fried at all. It was disappointing to come back to the table to 5 potstickers that were horrible looking and cost $7!\r\n",
      "At least my noodle bowl came out good. \r\n",
      "I suggest passing on the appetizers and people just ordering the noodle bowls\n",
      "Seriously absolutely horrible and so over priced!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I will never return to this place!  Tiny bowl for way too much money!  Sauces were horrible, seems like they maybe come from large tubs that are purchased from somewhere like Costco.  The little form they give you says you get to pick two sides with your stir-fry, I asked for my rice on the side.  The rice came in the bottom of the bowl soaked in the horrible sauce they offer!  Save yourself and don't eat here, not worth the money at all!  If you like these type of restaurants go to YCs.  Better meat, bigger bowls for less money, rice on the side, free soup, free ice cream and just an over all better experience!\n",
      "I am a regular at this particular location and I absolutely love the food! It is a hit or miss depending on how good you make your own bowl. The first few times I tried it, it turned out tasting a little weird. By now though I know exactly what to put in it to make it taste delicious!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My only small issue is the service. The service isn't horrible but it isn't fantastic either. I don't like how they bring your drinks to your table while you are in line. I would prefer them bring the drinks when I am back at the table instead of having my drink sit there unaccompanied.\n",
      "I was really disappointed.  I went with my husband and our 5 year old daughter before we went to see a movie, at first i was pleased, the hostess handed us a tiny bowl for our daughter and seated us right away.  from there it was horrible.  She tossed a menu down on the table and walked away, and me being used to Mongolian like at YC's this was way different.  I had to stop another employee to ask what we were supposed to do. he waved us over to the line where the food was and walked off.  I walked up and saw all the choices for meat, it didn't look like they kept it cold enough so i steered clear of any seafood and anything not marinated.  The vegetables mostly looked canned except for the mushrooms and the carrots.  The guys at the grill weren't happy to be there and they made no point of hiding that fact, they just pointed at our choices (rice, brown rice, udon noodles, or SERIOUSLY spiral macaroni) and grunted something, he handed us three cards and sent us off, by the time we got back to our table they had seated someone else at our table.  I was so upset I almost walked out at this point, but we didn't have time for anything else before the movie.  I would definitely NOT recommend this to ANYONE, all the food tasted horrible, go to YC's instead.\n",
      "We were excited to come to this Mongolian grill suggested by family.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "First of all, we visited on a Friday night. This location is in the Tempe Marketplace, an outdoor mall. Parking was horrible, and that is not the fault of the restaurant.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The restaurant wasn't too busy, and the hostess quickly seated our group. Something had apparently spilled on the floor near the bar long before we arrived and we all walked through it. The service and customers had spread whatever was spilled in a sticky mess all throughout the restaurant. Gross.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To top that, the first table we sat at was also sticky, and before the waitress came back, we had found ourselves a new table.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There is quite a selection of meats and veggies, this was a plus. However, the selection of sauces, while extensive, is completely (almost?) sugar-based. It would be nice to have had some options that were lower calorie or lower glycemic index. Even just oil and soy sauce would have been nice.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The service came around often, however she never checked to see what everyone needed before darted off to get one person's drink., which resulted in her needing to make many more trips.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Overall the food was really just so-so, and the fresh meat that others describe was actually frozen when we made our bowls.\n",
      "Do not go to this location! Horrible management and rewards program! I have been a Genghis Grill customer for the last five years. First I will say the food is fresh and I really enjoy the mongo BBQ sauce. It's spicy, but very tasty. Genghis is over-priced, so don't be shocked by the bill. Also, paying tip for someone that just brings you drinks is a little hard to justify. This location is no good! Today my table was numbered incorrectly and there was some confusion on delivering my tables bowls. Secondly, being a rewards member I received two emails offering me a two for $25 deal. The manager would not accept the email for the reason that it was only for their arrowhead location. Uh ok. So am I only a rewards member for one location? This is horrible service. After being a loyal customer I feel this deal should have been accepted. So I won't be going there again.\n",
      "This location is horrible! One its winter and cold as heck inside with all the fans going full blast, two there's nothing like gangster rap music playing loud as hell, then to top it off almost all the food bins were empty. We ordered our water and lemonade and only waited 15 minutes for it and the place was 20% full. This is one location we will never come back to plus it was pretty dirty around food area. Not sure why we even stayed\n",
      "I just had a horrible experience at Genghis Grill I was there with a friend she ordered a burger with bacon on it it came out the bacon with majorly undercooked they said they would bring her some crispy bacon when the bacon arrived it was still undercooked. I'm saying is if they're under cooking their food someone could get sick. I ordered pot stickers that were cold when they came out an undercooked too.:(:(:( We did make the management aware but this situation still ended up unresolved . I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.\n",
      "Honestly I never am one to complain, but this place is horrible! $12 for the smallest bowl of food ever. On top of that the set up is unorganized. We watched our food sit there ready for several minutes, while some guys who were behind us in line delivered their food before ours. We will not be returning!\n",
      "The raw food were prepared great but with poor explanation and very poor service. \r\n",
      "We arrived at 10:30and been told we only can do last shot so why not we were fine and glad to obey the rule.\r\n",
      "However they gave us the bill which we paid immediately before all food delivered except the deserts and ask for tips twice! How horrible someone kept asking for your money! I said I will leave it on the table.. And they just kept ask for that!!!! How creepy! \r\n",
      "I will not recommend to anyone who want to enjoy his/her dinner or lunch . \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "FYI they served DIY BBQ so you have to cook it yourself I am fine with that cause I am from canton. But I felt confused the time I walked in . No one tell me what s going on there! I thought it s a full service restaurant.\n",
      "I saw the reviews, but I thought I should give it a chance. I went here with my family, and we should have listened to the reviews. First, it's expensive. Second, they don't serve authentic korean food. To top it all of, the service is horrible. Orders were missing, and we asked some waiter for help and he said I'm not your waiter look for your waiter. The meat selection was horrible, and the meat didn't even taste good. I expected better quality or at least better service for the price they charge. Do yourself a favor and look for any other restaurant\r\n",

      "I could've given a 5 starts but the customer service was horrible. I was trying to be nice and even tried to make jokes to lighten up the mood, but he didn't want nothing from that. I understand that we need to pay 15% but the way our waiter spoke to us was disrespectful. Our waiter yesterday night was not listening to us and took really long to bring our ice cream at the end of the night. \r\n",
      "There are ways to explain the rules of the restaurant to customers in a respectful way. I really didn't want to give the tip but we had no choice apparently.\n",
      "Come here on a Saturday night. Tons of food choices including meat, seafood, sushis, hot food and dessert. Service is horrible when we almost finished the meal. the manager was keep on trying to kick our table out from the restaurant after we ordered 2 rounds. We will never come back.\n",
      "While visiting Montreal I decided to stop by here with a group of friends for a quick late night dinner. We were promptly seated but as soon as we ordered our food the experience went downhill. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After 10 minutes we were served a single bowl of edamame, allthewhile the table beside us recieved everything they ordered.\r\n",
      "Another 20 minutes passed and we received bits of our order - a tray or two of meat here and there - but nothing close to our original order. We then flagged our server down and asked what was taking the food so long. He told us to reorder, which we though was weird, but we did anyway.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We were still waiting on things as simple as miso soup and rice after hitting the 45 minute mark. Then our server brought us a large lump of rice on a single plate for all five of us to share. Never have I ever been to a Korean BBQ restaurant where one plate of rice was given for multiple people to share instead of given individual bowls.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After over an hour of waiting, reordering, and still not getting all of our food we asked to speak to a manager. The manager came over and insisted he would get us our missing items within 30 seconds - this was not the case. We had to wait an additional five minutes to receive our miso soup, which contained NO tofu whatsoever!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After all of this inconvenience we finally received everything we ordered. Overall the food tasted great, but the service was absolutely horrible and I will not be returning. I would not recommend coming here during late night hours. I do not normally leave Yelp reviews however I had to after having such a bad experience here.\n",

      "Mais le pire c'est l'hygiene!!!! Tres tres sale, le plancher, les tables, douteux sur la vaisselle, les toilettes horrible et pour finir l'un des serveur passait la mope pendant que nous etions encore en train de manger...sans compter l'odeur de la mope. Cher pour ce que c'est. Bruyant a souhait mais dommage car le concept est sympa.\n",
      "There wasn't anything special about the food. We went to have all you can eat sushi and didn't feel like we got what we paid for. The service was average. The food literally took 50 mins to come out. Come on the place has a 1 hour time limit and took that long to serve. Basically we only got to order 1 round and that's it. The fish also wasn't really fresh and was obvious.  I felt the place was a rip off. Not everything was horrible, the restaurant has a nice interior design and atmosphere. But other than that theres way more better sushi restaurant better than this in las Vegas.\n",
      "What was fresh about this place?  The waitresses' bad attitude and poor service.  3 of us did the AYCE for $26, and 1 person ordered a korean dish.  \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "First off, when we got seated, the waitress took 3 out of the 4 drink orders, and then walked away. We had to shout the 4th drink order.  After we ordered our AYCE sushi items (limited to one order of sea urchin (uni) and 1 order of sweet shrimp, we waited... and waited... for our food. The appetizers like the tempura and gyoza were fine, although I had to ask for tempura sauce.  What place does not bring tempura sauce with tempura? This should have been a red flag, as I had to ask for it. The rest of the sushi came out very very slow, especially for being nearly empty on a friday night at 7pm.  \r\n",
      "Finally the first sushi order (tuna) came out.  It's one thing if the sushi looks like it got rolled over by a car and died 2 weeks ago, but it actually tasted like it died 2 weeks ago and got rolled over by a car, and then sliced and put on top a very hefty wad of mushy rice.  It was tasteless.  The lack of flavor was attempted to be hidden by the sushi chef adding a clump of wasabi underneath.  \r\n",
      "The rice quality was nothing that great either. It was a step above the quality of rice found at the supermarket.  \r\n",
      "Everything else that came out had no flavor and there was a lack of excitement about the food.  \r\n",
      "We had to wait 90 minutes before we finally got fed up, and said, where is our uni?!  The manager in charge said he would go check.  He came back a couple minutes later saying it would be out in a couple minutes as they just opened up a new box.  (Really?  they couldn't have opened up the new box when we ordered the food?)  The uni was fine, nothing horrible, but nothing that great either.  \r\n",
      "The last sushi order they brought out was the white tuna which I usually like, but it was just horrible.  It was warm, melted in your mouth (not because it was good quality, but because it was just so waterlogged), and it had a weird almost alcoholic flavor to it. I spit it out and sent it back via the waitress who plainly ignored me until another waitress came by.  They were also very slow at servicing our table as we would stack our own plates to make room.  We also had to constantly ask for tea, but at least they kept my friend's soda cup full.  \r\n",
      "My korean friend told me that her korean dish was awful as well. She only ate half of it.  \r\n",
      "Overall, this restaurant is horrible.  The korean food is not good, and neither is the sushi.  1 star was given because that's the bare minimum that must be given and inside the restaurant looked very nice and modern.   This place does not deserve to serve sushi.\n",
      "my mom and i went there and the cold noodle dish was horrible - the noodles were overcooked so that it was a pile of mush, not to mention that my order came about 20 minutes before my mother's and they kept telling us my mom's order was coming up -- i think they are still trying to figure out the service portion of this restaurant especially for Koreans... they are much better with their service to non-Korean, I felt. it would have been great to have a good Korean restaurant but this isn't it.\n",
      "As Korean, I really love their Kimchi rather than their main meal. That doesn't mean their food is horrible, just want to say their Kimchi is really good. ( at least to the person what is Kimchi and what is taste like ).\r\n",

      "1. The food is extremely expensive. Gomtang at LA usually goes for about 7$ and here it's $10. \r\n",
      "2. Customer service is horrible. We ordered a korean pancake and they said they ran out when we came here for breakfast. And they didn't provide anything to make up for it. \r\n",
      "3. We have a little baby in the family and asked if we could just have a small bowl of soup for her because she wasn't hungry to eat a lot. They said they can't give it for free and it costs half price of the adult bowl. At LA they always give a little to babies just for service. And when they gave it, it came with no meat. Just soup for like 5 bucks. \r\n",
      "4. The gontang soup tastes just okay. The soup is a little clear and it's because they use a lot of water and I can taste the msg in it. I'm gonna be super thirsty later. \r\n",
      "5. The one star only goes for the kkak doo gee (Korean kimchi radish) and the kimchee but I would not come again. \r\n",
      "Even after the horrible service, they still charged us for the little soup. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This just shows that they want money and don't care about their customers because they have no competition. They're the only Korean restaurant around. Come if you're in Vegas and miss Korean food but this I'm so tired but I have to goto practice):made my family leave Vegas in a horrible mood.\n",
      "Heard this place is fabulous. Well, to me, it's not very attractive at all. Food is good but the service is horrible.\r\n",
      "The lady who attended us was very strict about table arrangement - we're 12 total but not allowed to put tables together and sit altogether. No point insisting that while there is only couple more groups of people eating.\r\n",

      "As a Korean-American I take my kimchi very seriously. I've had acceptable to horrible kimchi at korean restaurants in Las Vegas.This place comes pretty close to my moms kimchi and that's saying alot. :)\n",
      "Do not come here if u are hungry. You have to be willingly able to wait for 1 1/2 hrs just for the food to come out plus an additional 20 mins to get in. There were a lot of angry customers when I went, some people had to cancel their order cause their food wouldn't come out while others were already eating. The food is honestly not even that good either, the customer service was also horrible. I advise you not to come.\n",
      "Second time eating at the Pineville location. The service was horrible and slow. There was only one waitress, and at least 10 people dining. The food was alright, but the service made the experience not enjoyable. Will not be returning to this location.\n",
      "So people just go nuts for this place and I'm not entirely sure why. We tried this location out last night for a quick and easy Friday night dinner while we were out and about running errands. We got there before the crowd, and our overall impression was that the location is nice, but a little hidden, but that is no fault of the restaurant. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "All things considered, the food was pretty decent. We did not get the wings, as we are trying to be a little bit more healthy. We split the salmon stuffed avocado and it was actually pretty delicious. We also split an order of the Korean tacos. Here is where they lost stars. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The service was horrible. They had one girl sitting at the front door on her phone pretty much the whole time. Two other ladies were servers, and seemed to hit every table but ours. Even as the restaurant filled up we still expected someone to come refill our water, ask us if we wanted another beer, or at least come take our plates away when we were done and ready for our check. When we ordered the avocado, we asked for cucumbers asked for them on the side and the waitress said that wasn't able- which may be able but she could have also just asked quickly. We ordered anyway and my husband just picked out the cucumbers and put them on my plate. When the tacos out, I waved the waitress for an extra of a spicy mayo and it took her over 5 min to bring it over. Again, we were able to look over that, but we had to have another waitress take away our plates after 10 minutes with no service. We when she did come clear the plates we asked for our check and she said sure I'll take it care for you. And then proceed to completely forget she had any recollection she spoke with us. Meanwhile our original waitress never came to check in on us despite now having nothing left on our table. My husband finally gave up and went to the bar and just asked for a check. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I hate writing poor reviews, and I really do like Bonchon's food. But the service definitely tempered our experience given that we spent more time at the table after we ate than it took to get actually eat. I hope they start getting it right!\n",
      ".....I'm embarrassed to even say I went to eat here. That's how horrible it is. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Atmosphere: not enough ventilation for a bbq joint. Only 1 of 4 burners we had were working properly so we had to ask the kitchen to prepare our meats.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Price: overpriced for the quality of foods. Your required to order a minimum of 2 of the kalbi and bulgogi which is $30+ an order but when you cook it it's less than a small Plate of meat for 2. I guess I'm used to California portions. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Food: I think if we had the opportunity to grill our own meats to the doneness of how we like it - it would have tasted ok. My kids came to dinner bc they offered sushi.. They didn't have sushi at all. Hot stone wasn't even hot stone it was rice no crispy under bottom. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Service: we asked for a couple minutes to look at the menu and the waitress never came back. My husband had to flag her down. Then well one of our burners didn't work bc our server elbowed our drink into the grill.  Changed it out but didn't work and then it seemed like it affected the burner next to it. They didn't replace the drink until I asked for it. Then we got a bill and still had to pay gratuity. After we paid our server came back and mumbled something about sorry for not giving us any service. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Would I recommend? No never \r\n",
      "What I can I suggest to this place to improve? \r\n",

      "1 star rate is totally for the restaurant itself.\r\n",
      "I rate 5 stars for the service, our waiter is so friendly and attentive, he always checks on us and ask if we need anything. Service is very satisfied. My friends and I try out this restaurant because we saw ads on Facebook. Since we all love eating Korean BBQ we decided to give it a try. Taste wise is average. Price is reasonable. The grill is horrible, really do need more maintenance or even change a new one. All the meats that we order were cook with very low heat which dried it out when it's cooking (yes, we did turn the grill to highest heat). Also the kitchen takes a while to prepare meat dishes, so there was a long pause between each time that we put in order. We don't really enjoy the transition between service at all, and the restaurant really do need an improvement.\n",
      "Ehhh I don't know about this place. I honestly hate writing reviews like this but I have to be straight forward on what I think about this restaurant.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Here it goes.. This was the old takamatsu. I was one of the regulars then. I love korean bbq and been to a variety  all over AZ and Cali. It's one of my favorite foods to eat and I never get tired of it either. Bf and I wanted to check this place out since it was lunch time and we were around the area.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We walked in and was greeted. There were about 4 to 5 food servers on a slow week day. There was about 3 customers eating inside ant that's including us. All were just standing because its slow but we were serviced by all as well. Which was a little confusing because some would ask the same question about what we wanted on the menu. We told them several times we already ordered and got this...\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We were served our food. The meats are very low quality, sauces they have wasn't great nor good either. They gave me msg plus salt on the side. Everything tasted plain. It's $14 a person for all you can eat. So who can complain right? It's cheap so therefore the quality of the food you're eating is what you paid for. That's why there's a saying you get what you paid for. The service was good but could be better because I feel like they dont communicate on which server should take care of which customer. There's also too many of them so I get it they're probably trying to keep busy and probably bored. Other than that I won't be coming back. Sorry to say this is the worst kbbq ever. Food was just horrible and I am just being honest here.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Better meat quality can improve this place a lot better and have some seafood selections it will catch more customers. Oh and get more sauces on the side not msg and salt please.\n",
      "Came here for dinner after a Raptors game, because we were craving Korean bbq. I've been here a few times and it's okay, not amazing but not horrible.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To begin, the service is okay. I mean, there's a bunch of waiters that will be helping you out. Majority of them are nice, but make sure you look at what they are giving you, because sometimes they can get confused. However, the waiter did let us know that the tips were included, which is a huge plus because some Korean bbq places do not tell you.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The place itself is alright. I personally feel like it's so crowded in there that you can literally hear other people's conversations around you. Also, the washrooms are pretty gross! So I suggest you don't use it unless you really have to.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The food was alright. I personally loved the beef and thought it was the best to cook. Ribs were also good, but the beef was better. One sad thing is that this place does not have dessert, not even ice-cream!!\n",
      "Service was horrible. Sat down for about 5 minutes and no one came to serve us. Asked 2 different waiters for waters and it literally took 10 minutes for WATER to come. Then it took 10-15 more minutes for food to come as if we weren't already starving. The food was also horrible. Sprouts weren't spicy. Kimchi also wasn't spicy. I understand they're busy but that's no way to treat customers. Definitely not coming back again.\n",
      "Very overpriced. The owner there is trying to cut down food cost so much that the quality of meat and vegetables that are used here is horrible. Do not go here. I would go to Galleria supermarket instead. Galleria has much more authentic korean food and the price is less then half of Joon's. DO NOT GO.\n",
      "This isn't the first time I ate at Joons, but it would definitely be my last. The only reason I still eat there despite its horrible service and selection of appetizer is because of their table cooking. I'll admit, I like their table cooking selections (I personally go for the chicken one) and along with that I always add a few side dishes to add to it. My typical selection is cheese, noodles x2 since we have two people and sweet potato. As usual, I ordered this except this time the waiter told me in half-understandable English that I can only order one noodle, even if I want to pay extra for it. Okay? So you don't want my money? And what kind of policy is it to not let customer order what they like? Fine, I got over that since it's not such a big deal. As usual, the appetizers did not come until nearly 20 minutes later. And no, asking them for it would not make it any faster. Infact, they had it on the counter all along but still didn't want to give it to you. I can confidently say this is their way of doing things because all four times I went, things never improved. The appetizers consist of: two pieces of broccoli, half a scoop of potato, some kimchi and a few beans. Every time I see it it just makes me not want to go back. Onto the horrendous main course that used to be good: Table Cooking. We decided to try something new today: Tofu Table Cooking. Everything seemed normal until we took a bite at the tofu, it was incredibly sour, not what a NON-EXPIRED tofu should taste like. YUCK! There is a saying that restaurants that are afraid of letting customers eat would not stay open for long, as they oppose the fundamentals of even opening a restaurant. DEFINITELY not recommended!\n",
      "Only few measure of a good Korean restaurant. Pork bone soup was undercooked. Tofu soup and expired ingredients. And nearly impossible unless under horrible conditions, the Kimchi was expired. The cucumber Kimchi was just a cucumber in water. The servers are all confused as hell. They brought out the mains before the Kimchi and the rice much afterwards.\n",
      "taste not bad but disgusting  . I would give 1star because I loved. pls check the sauce every time when you eating at bbq premium that's horrible.\n",
      "Service was horrible. They were slow and keep on forgetting our table, such as side dishes, rice and water. I also expected a big plate for hot and spicy chicken with cheese, but i get 1/4 of the plate, i had to pay 24.99 for that crap!\n",
      "Affordable, delicious, cholesterol-raising American-Korean-Mexican fusion food is found here. On a whim, I ordered the fried chicken wings and was impressed and pleased they were served large and piping hot. They came with sauces on the side (my request) and I wished I had them dressed before hand because they would've been 100x better. The carne asada fries was pleasantly unexpected from the usual. I think the dish would benefit it they switched to thinner fries. My sister and dad gave their  bulgogi hotdogs a greasy thumbs up. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Service throughout was attentive and sweet. The server kept his cool with an extremely rude customer, so major props to him. Other than the horrible and small parking, I would gladly come here again to get my junk food binges satisfied.\n",
      "I really wish Yelp had half stars, because this restaurant stands at a solid 3.5 stars. I don't think there's anything special enough about it to warrant four stars, but it's not so average that it's a three.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There is a good amount of dishes available on the menu at reasonable prices too. I came here with two friends and we split the japchae bowl and two snacks + a pop (we chose ddeokbokki and beef skewers), and the garlic fried chicken. While nothing wowed me too much, I have to say that every dish was pretty well made and worth the money I paid for. We wanted the sweet rice drink but was told it was unavailable at the time, which was disappointing but not so horrible that it reflects negatively on the restaurant. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Service was okay. The waitresses were friendly and visited us pretty often while we were looking at the menu, but we had to ask them twice to bring us hot sauce. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I wish that I wanted to rate this place higher, because I think it has good potential and decent food. I can definitely see myself returning in the future if it were not situated in an awkward location. I only came today to try out a new place, but there isn't much else in the area (unless you want to visit Rona). I hope that something changes in the future that really makes this place pop.\n",
      "Since I'm Korean and have had many MANY experiences with Korean fried chicken, both in Korea and Canada, I would have to say my experience at K-pop chicken was okay - not superb, not horrible. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I live right by the area, so I decided to call ahead and order some for take-out. I ordered 1/2 Green Onion and 1/2 Sweet & Spicy for three people, and the portions were definitely enough. I liked how the pieces were actually meaty and big, and we were pretty satisfied with both the sauces/flavours.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One thing I was really disappointed in was the pickled radish side dish. Anyone who's had Korean fried chicken knows that a good tastin' pickled radish is absolutely ESSENTIAL. But the taste of the radish was very off, almost as if it were about to go bad but hadn't fully gone there yet. Since I've had it many times throughout my life as a side dish, I know what it's generally supposed to taste like, and theirs was just... weird. Given that other reviewers have had no such problem though, I'd like to think this was a one-time occurrence. Looking back, we should have called them to let them know. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Overall, I liked the taste and the portions, so I will probably go back to try the other sauces on their menu, and also their on-tap beer (chicken + beer combo is a classic that cannot be beat!). I have high hopes that their pickled radish will be normal next time!\n",
      "I love Korean food and have ate at a lot of Korean restaurants.. This is by far the worst Korean restaurant in Las Vegas. The food is horrible, the service is just as bad. Server didn't know the difference between one soup from another. They charged a soup dish $10 bucks that would be free at any other Korean restaurant. No wonder the place was empty like a ghost town. Will never eat here again..\n",
      "Despite the horrible parking lot, food is consistently good here!! I've been here 3 times and gotten food to go once and they have yet to mess anything up. Definitely a lot closer than driving to bonchon. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I was in a party of 3 and we were greeted and seated promptly in a booth. Their booths are pretty large and can seat 6, maybe 8. They have 4 booths and quite a few tables that can accommodate larger parties.\r\n",

      "Korean music was playing but not too loud with the Music video projected on the wall. Cute decor with hanging lights. Clean bathrooms!\r\n",

      "Condiments are on the table. They give you a water pitcher so you don't need to keep waving the server over for refills. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There's a board of soju flavors on the wAlls on the booths. Buy 2, get one free! We got yogurt, mango and pineapple (or peach) last time!  Yogurt was the best one. Also, beers, soju, sake and cocktails are buy 2 get one free!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We were told the supreme (medium spicy) and soy garlic were the best flavors so that's what we went with. Note: you can only order half and half sauces for the 20 piece OR the family Whole chicken ($21). GET THE SUPREME AND SOY GARLIC SAUCE!!! You won't regret it! The supreme was a bit spicy for me but I liked it more than the soy garlic, which I found to be a bit on the sweet side. The supreme chicken wings were a bit too saucy but I just rubbed off the excess sauce on my plate. One thing that I did not like was that the chicken wings came out warm and not piping hot. Also, I would recommend that they provide a small bucket for the bones like other places.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "3/5 The bulgogi kimbab (think of Korean sushi with bulgogi and veggies) had fresh veggies and was pretty good. I thought it would be a small portion for $6 but it was big!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "5/5 We also ordered the bulgogi fried rice ($9). There was corn, bell peppers, a fried egg on top and onions. Bulgogi was well seasoned. The rice had sort of a charbroiled taste to it which was surprisingly pleasant. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Banchan included macaroni salad, pickled radish, kimchi, fishcake and spinach (I could be wrong about this last one). Fishcake was decent. My sister raved about the macaroni salad but I thought it was just ok. But the side dishes are complimentary and refillable. Kimchi was super fermented, therefore super sour. I like my kimchi kind of fresh and not super fermented so I didn't enjoy it. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My friends and I definitely went overboard with the ordering but the atmosphere was good and we really enjoyed the soju! It's a chill environment and doesn't get too loud. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When our food took longer than usual, the server came out and apologized to us but the wait wasn't too bad.\n",
      "I had high hopes but unfortunately its's just....ok.  I got an order of the soy glazed drumettes and wings.  Portion size is good, the meat is juicy and tender.  The just ok part is the flavor and the crunchiness of the batter.  The soy glazed was overwhelmingly sweet l, like almost straight corn syrup with a hint of soy.  I was hoping for a savory sweet soy garlic like bonchon but it doesn't compare.  Also there was way too much sauce (think pool on plate), it definitely made the batter coating a little softer.  Bonchon is horrible because their chicken is dry and small...if only this place could get the flavor and batter right then we would be definitely above just an ok rating.  I might go back and try their original and see if it's any better\n",
      "This place is horrible. I would give it a zero star if I could. The waitress was not attentive and so rude. Felt like she just wanted to brush us off. We asked for a to-go box and she ignored us. Before that, we waited for the check and she walked passed by us completely ignoring us. And before that, we waited and waited for her to take our order. I asked for some spiced please and that didn't go anywhere. I will never eat here again.\n",
      "Worst chinese food I have ever tried in my whole life, the presentation were horrible, taste doesn't corresponding the dish taste supposed to be. The worst was most of them are precooked n microwave reheat for you. This is Vegas, at this price range I do Not expect to have microwave food. Is not the first time been to Vegas but for sure this is the last time to this restaurant. Very disappointed.\n",
      "Going to this place was a horrible experience: long wait to be seated, rude staff and disgusting food. Nothing at this place is worth experiencing.\n",
      "This place is so horrible!!! Do not eat here!!! Don't waste your time try coming here, I think everyone should be fired. Long story short me and my wife walked in to get dinner. The reception lady ask how many people I kindly replied 2 she said ok wait so we did after about 2 groups were seated, I ask her about how long to be seated? She than said how many?\n",
      "This restaurant had a big line to eat and the waiting system here is absolutely horrible. They make you stand in line for over an hour with no pager or any other system which would allow the guests to sit in casino or do something else. Also none of the restaurants in Bellagio including Noodles has a couch or waiting area which would allow the patrons to sit. This reflects a very callous attitude by bellagio where they dont have a couch or a pager system. \r\n",

      "The worst pad Thai I've ever tasted. Save your money. Order something else! Noodles are so hard to chew. Guess they're not done. The taste- horrible!\n",
      "Went there after late O show. The weak reviews are accurate. A mixed bad of Asian food with no standouts. Noodle dishes were bland and salt and pepper shrimp was adequate but overpriced ($33). Service is horrible. They didn't serve rice with main course and we had to ask for it. No soy on table and request went in again. We won't be back.\n",
      "I thought the decor here was clever. They stacked hundreds of bottles filled with dried noodles all along the shelves. It made for interesting visuals.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The food, on the other hand, is just cheap, over priced Chinese food basically. The pho served here doesn't taste like traditional pho either. Their soup base tasted more like Chinese broth and the rice noodles were chewy. Their fried rice was horrible...$15 for fried rice with barely any vegetables or char siu...what a ripoff. I could have done better myself. Their baby spinach dish along with their chicken curry, which I had to admit were pretty good, were their redemption from a one star rating.\n",

      "My friends and I discovered the simple logic of Noodles' pricing. Take the price you would pay at any regular Asian restaurant not located in the Bellagio and multiply it by 2. We found this out the hard way when we all decided to get a bowl of white rice for each of us and saw that once we got the bowl it was $4 per bowl and that my glass of cranberry juice was $4.50. I mean I don't expect anything else since it is in the Bellagio but just giving you all a heads up.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The food I would give it a 3.5-4 (Crab vermicelli is delishhhh) but the reason I gave a 2 is because of the service. Unless they are trying to give you a really authentic experience of an Asian restaurant, which includes horrible service, then I get it. Other than that, there should be no reason why the service in such a high class place such as the Bellagio should be so bad! They seriously need some extra hospitality training. We would call our waitress to get us another glass of water for the billionth time and she would raise her finger up at us as if to hush us and rush off. Granted she did give us our water eventually, but every time we asked for something it was as if every waiter and waitress were walking by so fast to avoid being called on by anyone or it would be given reluctantly. Come on now, if I'm paying $4 for a tiny bowl of white rice I better be getting some tip top service!\n",
      "This was a horrible experience. Ive come hear before and had pretty good service but today we waited over an hour and thirty minutes to have people who showed up after us to be seated first. I literally watch people who checked in after us go complain to the front counter and then magically somehow got seat before us . Instead of go to the front to complain like the other I decide to take my business elsewhere. Hopefully management will fix this problem so people who are trying to be nice to the staff and not give them a hard time can be seated when they're suppose to. Im not by any means trying to say the staff was not doing there job. Because to be honest if a customer was bitching at me i would want to seat them as soon as possible too but its still not fait to other customers .\n",
      "Will not return to this restaurant. Service was horrible. Waitress assigned to our table seemed like she hated her job. From the moment we sat down she had a bad attitude.

      "Came here late night with some friends, the wait wasn't too bad. Didn't like the tongue too much, it was very chewy. But I highly recommend the brisket and cheese corn. Service wasn't horrible but we did have to ask 2-3 times for the basics like rice & water.\n",

But the manager came over took over the table and from that point it was much better. Out of the 15 times I've been lol I've only had one service experience which was bad. I believe it was just that specific waitress who was horrid. \r\n",

      "The only advice I would give to the owner, stop changing prices on your customers. I understand your restaurant is doing great, I was at the soft opening and from that point to now, which hasn't even been a couple months yet, they've increased their prices and put a lot more limits on food and cut the portions of their food. I understand this tends to happen over time but it happened too fast and almost immediately after they realized they hit a goldmine in this restaurant. \r\n",

      "I advise you go here either before 5 pm or after 8pm otherwise you'll be waiting for over an hour before you get to eat! It's that busy!\n",
      "Ordered through skip the dishes twice now. Amazing. Chicken is crispy even after the car ride and the subs are awesome. Have had the sweet and sour as well as the mustard and plain chicken. Way better than your kfc or chicken on the way. Not too greasy or too over salted which both other places have. Popeyes is out of the question because it's horrible. The beef bulgogi sub is the way to go. Don't eat out often but for an unhealthy treat this is good stuff. Will definitely be ordering again.\n",
      "If you're coming and expecting all you can eat KOREAN BBQ, don't come here. The marinated meat is good but you can only order pork, beef and chicken meat, bulgogi and LA kalbi; didn't include samgyupsal.  And you have to pay extra for lettuce, garlic and samjang (Korean dipping sauce). We were very dissapointed, not to mention one the waiters looked like he hated his job, so it kind of made us uncomfortable. It wasn't a horrible experience, but not the K-BBQ experience we were hoping for.\n",

      "The food and service at this place is usually great. However, tonight we just had a horrible experience. The portion of the food was inconsistent. On top of that, we came across a few employees who were very unprofessional. They were talking poorly of us when we were right across them. They took our order and promptly kicked us without any warning. The server with curly long black hair and glasses was very rude when we were being polite. We can understand if you need space for other customers. However, there is always a way to do it. If you do not like your job, please give us a big favor and quit. You work in food service learn how to have decent respect towards customers.\n",

      "Yesterday we tried a new Korean BBQ place called Doh. The food was amazing welly seasoned and marinated. Although the service was horrible the waiter did not speak to us she had an attitude the whole time she was speaking very low and wasn't mumbling her words, but the environment is nice I love the sitting down and cooking your own food environment all in all the rating is a 5\n",
      "Absolutely horrible. My fianc챕 and I went here about 6 months ago and found hair in our food. We then ended up here again on New Year's Eve (wish I hadn't given prior experience) and again found hair in our food (wish I could make it up). We also went to a party after dinner and both ended up getting sick. I will NEVER go there again. Absolutely horrible service. Horrible quality of food. UPDATE: both STILL having major stomach pains and this was the last place we ate at.  Never again.\n",

      "I came to Gogi when it first opened and our service was so horrible that I haven't came back until recently. I was really craving some nice cold nengmyun and my friend and I decided to come give this place a try. The restaurant was not very busy and we were seated right away. When we tried to order the nengmyun the server said they ran out. We were supper bummed and we're getting ready to leave. My friend and I were trying to find other Korean restaurants that had it but most of them are closed on a Tuesday so we really didn't have much options to pick from. Thankfully our server came back and said they just made some broth so we were able to get it. Our food came out fairly fast and the side dishes were good. My favorite was the steamed egg they brought out! Everything about our dish looked yummy! The broth was really flavorful , the noodles were soft and I liked that they gave us more then one piece of meat. I don't understand why restaurants do that for some of their dishes. \r\n",
      "Anyways it definitely satisfied my cravings and it was the perfect way to beat the heat. This time my experience was way better then the one I had a couple of years ago and I will be back!\n",
      "I used to love their food, but recently the service was just horrible. Last time I went to the restaurant, it took a while to receive our order and they forgot the small dishes that I needed to ask for them- which was fine cause they were under staffed. But today, I was seated, waited for more than 10 mins- oh I checked my phone so I was very sure I waited for mk ore than 10 mins- no water, no menu no utensil. Me and my family was completely ignored- even when we stood up and waved our hands to raise attention of the waitresses... The understaffed situation has become ridiculous. I give it two stars because the food is still good...if you have time to wait and don't care about poor service\n",
      "Been there lots of times since they had opened. Their food and service were good at that time, but last three time visit was horrible. Food tasting was pretty good and lunch special is also good, but the service was very uncomfortable. \r\n",

      "There was hair in a soup, so we complained. We didnt eat at all, but they just charged all food cost with 10% comp. We didnt say anything since we thought we are regular customers. Anyway I wont go back, Ban chan 1mile up there food taste and service is much better\n",
      "This place has slowly improved over the years. I came during their grand opening and had a horrible experience with expensive and small portions.  My second time was about a year after that and there was dramatic improvement.  The Korean chirashi was only $10 - cheapest I've had.  The portion was large but the salad part was mostly cabbage which is unusual and didnt taste as good.  Came back tonight (2 years later) and there was further improvement. That same Korean Chirashi had large slices of sashimi and some cabbage but this time lots of real mixed greens.  This time the amount of sweet spicy sauce was way too excessive and drowned the salad.  Their sauce is also sweeter than I prefer so I will need to ask for the sauce on side next time like how it is usually served. Easy fix and still cheap $11.  My tofu soup was decent and only $8.99.  Not sure if I like it enough to be back but it's a decent place overall.\n",
      "Second time was the charm !  First visit during grand opening week was horrible. Bad service and food was not the best. BUT I came back after hearing the good reviews to verify for myself.  Gotta try the Hot Stone Bowls (beef, chicken, pork, or tofu).  Presentation was awesome. Your meat of choice is served on a bed of rice along side various  saut챕ed vegetables and topped with an over easy style egg. It comes out sizzling hot and you can hear the sound it makes like when you order a fajita dish at a Mexican restaurant. Huge portion so I had it for lunch and leftovers for dinner :)\n",
      "Had the noodle soup with chicken didn't taste good at all plus the chicken was not cooked properly the meat was red!!!!! My son had the chicken teriyaki chicken the chicken was dry overcooked had no taste we had to ask for more sauce which took over 10 mins to get!!!! The ribeye tasted horrible!! Ordered California rolls also worst I had! We told the waitress showed her the chicken in the soup and told her about the chicken teriyaki all she could say was sorry!\n",
      "Came here with the family as we were really in the mood for good Korean food. Seeing 4 stars on Yelp,we headed over. My Nang Myun was okay, but the rest of my family wasn't impressed. The Kalbi was not very flavorful, just a few Ban Chan, and the Kim Chi fried rice was horrible.  Every Korean restaurant I've been to, will flood your table with Ban Chan. As other reviews have mentioned, the service isn't that great either.\n",
      "We ate there today and the service was the woratbi ever see at a Korean restaurant. The Asian waiters excuse they were short a server. We asked for a refill of the side dishes and the Asian waitress never came back to service us. To all you foodies I Do not recommend this restaurant. The Sashimi was horrible at $ 19.99 and the Bulgogi was okay nothing to jump up and down. Out here on Yelp you find a couple more Korean food restaurants with awesome service and better authentic tasting Korean food with the taste from Korea. I will let all my ass Hayes k ow not to eat here Thank you.\n",
      "The food here was horrible. We went only once but will not be going back, perhaps we went on the wrong day and the regular cooks weren't in, cuz it seemed like whoever made our food had no idea how to cook! Soft tofu soup tasted like a weak broth soup and pork bbq was burnt and dry. Giving 2 stars for our polite waiter.\n",
      "SUCKS. \r\n",
      "This place sucks af. It states that it opens till 10pm but when we came in at around 8:50pm. They told us it is cash only. After we ordered, we saw a few Korean students paying with cards. They have the credit card machine but they made us to pay with cash. \r\n",
      "The service, horrible. \r\n",
      "There was not enough rice for everyone after 8:30pm. No more side dishes, no full menu available. \r\n",

      "It is a waste of money and your time\n",
      "I basically served our hot pot because the server said I have to go get side dishes for you guys so can you do this for me? Okay that's fine, I understand you're busy but they never came around to check up on korean bbq. We basically cooked and cut our own meat. Horrible horrible service. Usually I never complain about service but this place was plain horrible and I will never come back. Rude service and food is not worth it for it's price and disrespectful service we got.\n",

Haven't got this bad of service in a while and i'm not the kind of person to complain about the service since i'm also a waitress and I understand that its a hard job but it was horrible at a point where it ruined the night of all my friends including myself. At least, food wasnt not bad but people should some at least some effort when serving..\n",

      "\r\n",
      "How disappointed can we be?  This was horrible. Not just, we just opened and are working out the kinks bad...I mean just plain awful. The side dishes came out and there was water in our potato's, the sprouts were not ripe, and the dumplings were soft shelled and still frozen.   When the meat came out the kalbi was literally flavorless outside a touch of gaminess, the bulgoki was ok, and our chadol baegi has been obviously shaved and THEN frozen. This means all the little shaved slices stuck together and you ended up with a hot mess. Two of my wife's pieces actually had freezer burn and was almost grey. At that point she was done and we just wanted to leave. \r\n",

      "I will start by saying that I have been here multiple times and one only does reviews when the service is less the great. I came with a party of six. Which were my inlaws to make things worse. We arrived at the restaurant at about 9:15 PM and were informed that the wait would be about 45 min. Which is excepted at a place like this. The whole time waiting I keep telling and bragging about the place. When we sat down at around 10:05pm, we were told that 10:30pm the kitchen would close and we could not order more, which is fine. I explained to the waitress that the rest of the family had not been here and if she could explain. Very rudely she said read the menu. I took over and order when asked how much food I wanted I stated enough for all to try the food. Mind you we were 6. I ordered about 4 things and when they arrived it was one piece of meat for  all 6 of us the size about 6 inches long. I asked the waitress why did she only bring me this she stated I only said one. I then expressed myself by saying that I needed enough for everyone to try a piece. And one was not enough and I did not want to waste food. I ordered more food and with a very bad attitude she brought our food. We asked for suggestions and she said get more of what you have. That's not really a suggestion when there is 40 options. In a time spand of about 15 min we had to try to order all the food we wanted without over ordering. We keep asking for service of napkins and refills who the waitress would hardly ever come around after 10:30pm. I just tried to make the best of this. At 11 she passed the bill. I was displeased but did not want to say anything. We still had food cooking and had food on our plates. Shorty after I paid the turned off the TV and the AC and the light. Were in AZ and you turn off then ac what are you trying to tell us. This is when I became really upset. Now were eating with a bbq in our table and no ac. I got up to speak to the manager and of course no one could help. I was very disappointed and embarrassed with my family. I have never had an experience like this. I know this might not be the service the usually provide but tonight I will really think of ever going back. A future tip is if you close at 11 please do not take clients after 9:30pm. I would much rather be told this, then have this horrible service again.\n",
      "Saw the decent reviews so checked it out. My goodness, budae jigae was horrible. It wasn't budae jigae at all. It was a big kimchi jigae. Other dishes were also not that good. Seems to me the people in the kitchen don't know what they're doing. Wish I could give it zero stars but 1 star cause their service was good. There are other Korean restaurants in Las Vegas that's better than this place. Try somewhere else..\n",
      "That food was absolutely not fresh and gave me an upset stomach for a day. The smell of the beef and pork is questionable and very greasy. The miso soup was horrible, I never thought you could mess up miso but they figured it out!\n",

      "I wish I could give negative stars. I came here for the first time and told my waiter that I don't eat meat; he recommended a dish so I got it, when he served it I realized it was literally just lettuce (mind you this dish is $8). I complained and one server told me I could potentially get my money back. The manager came over and informed me that since the food left the kitchen I could not get a refund for the food I didn't eat (they took it away when I complained). They also don't let you share food and will reprimand you for it. Horrible place, horrible service, will NEVER come back.\n",

      "First of all, this place is claustrophobic. Everything is cramped and unorganized. When you walk around, it feels like they just put products wherever they can fit them. Good luck trying to get around with a cart since the aisles are very narrow. Also, double check anything that you buy here! I have already noticed a few times that they leave expired and damaged products on the shelves. Horrible! I know that this is a Korean market, but they used to have a lot more Japanese items in the past. I see less and less each time I come here.\r\n",

I'm not sure if it was coming from the food court area or the market area, but it made me feel sick. I mean come on, the least they could do is thoroughly air the place out! Customer service is pretty horrible. The employees do not care and just shove their way past you without saying anything. I was here about a week ago, and as we were checking out, the woman who was bagging our groceries just decided to stop halfway. Yup, walked away and never came back. After paying, the cashier started to ring up the next customer, so my mother-in-law and I bagged the last of our groceries ourselves. I mean seriously?? WTF?? They should just have a self check-out lane at this point!\r\n",

We brought in drinks from outside which he told us we couldn't do when he saw (which was fine) but the way he handled it was very poor. He literally took the drinks out of our hands as if we were children and started grabbing drinks from our bags. I don't mind buying drinks there or following the rules, but after being treated like I've committed a horrible crime for bringing in a drink (into a room that I'm paying to use) I won't go back here. Go to J Karaoke-much better! The host there was extremely nice, helpful, and gracious and we happily bought drinks there.\n",

If you wanna talk about food, I'd recommend anything bulgogi! I also enjoy the soups they have here. Usually the typical dish my family and I order.

      "We stayed for two hours and didn't order anything from the menu because we all ate beforehand. They had a HUGE range of songs were up to date to the most popular. Some songs were from Korea, Japan, Philippines, and many more. The room came with three mics and one standing mic. The room also came with two light-up tambourines which were fun to use for those who weren't singing. The projection was nicely bright and clear to read the lyrics too. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Overall, despite the stench and the heat, our party still had a good time, and we sang our hearts out! The staff is friendly and the place is clean. Surprisingly I would come back to Karaoke Q. They actually more affordable compared to other karaoke places and have an extensive selection. I just hope they get those two minor problems fixed soon.\n",
      "i've been to quite a few karaoke studios in my time but none in vegas until karaoke q.\r\n",
      "we came here with a group of pals after dinner one night.\r\n",
      "the lobby/bar/waiting room area is small and blasting horrible music that i believe was supposed to be hip hop while the tv's played kpop videos.  \r\n",
      "i think i would have preferred to hear the kpop video music over whatever was blasting through the speakers.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "the karaoke room itself is quite plain and boring.\r\n",
      "they don't offer any decent snacks either.\r\n",
      "the videos for the songs are all the same on a loop from lmfao to kpop to idk what.\r\n",
      "it was more distracting than anything else.\r\n",
      "we were never checked on while we were there.\r\n",
      "the song selection is not bad though.\n",
      "I ordered half chicken extra crispy last week and it was horrible. The chicken was still raw inside and we got really sick. I will never order from this place again\n",
      "Wow chicken has the best fried chicken in the city. It's too bad their service is so horrible. I've been forgotten numerous times regardless of how full the restaurant is. They told me what I would like and what I wouldn't and wouldn't let me order what I wanted. It's so good though! I wonder when I'll have had enough of the bad service to stop eating there.\n",
      "Oh my mantra! Korean food is definitely an intense craving for many, and having this place so close to the McGill campus probably brings in lots of cash! \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The menu is cute, they have most of the things you would expect from a Korean place. Also, I like how they altered the menu for students aka cheap people! For example, you can save $1 from the Bibimbap if you don't get it in a stone bowl. Thus, that's what i did! \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My bibimbap wasn't bad. It was pretty standard, nothing special and nothing too horrible. The side dishes they have were less than mediocre. There were only three and none were exceptional. My friends all got something different and everyone was pleased with their meal. My friend got the fried tofu and kimbap special and she loved it!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Overall, not the best, but it will satisfy your craving!\n",
      "I'm going to be real, when I came to this place I was super depressed that day and I just didn't feel good at all. This place however took my mind off it all.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Before my order, the man behind the counter was very helpful. I asked the man behind the counter how big their portions are. He told me 3 hot dogs were roughly the size of one burger and I knew if I ordered that much I most likely could not finish my meal. I also asked what were the usual favorites, his personal favorites and what he would recommend, very helpful service. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They had really good fries, If you're going to eat here might as well order some angry fries to go with your hot dogs cause those fries took all my anger away lol. I ordered the Bulgogi Hot Dog and the Philly Dog and the first bite into the hot dog was absolute bliss. I forgot everything that was bothering me... it was like all the stress was packed into a balloon and flew further away after each bite into the hot dog. The food was so good that I wanted to order more but being a tiny dude I could barely finish one dog. I decided to just order more take it to go and eat it later.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The place had some wonderful music mixed with great food, it made me feel really good. I would recommend this place to all my friends due to how unique their menu is. (where else can you get bulgogi toppings on a hot dog?) This is a really special place, great prices, cool music soundtrack and wonderful people. They kept asking if everything was tasting okay, I loved the attention I was getting! Any food that makes me feel this great deserves a wonderful review. Everyone should try this place at least once in their lifetime, your experience may not be similar to mine unless you go in a very horrible mood lol but nonetheless the food is still great.\n",
      "Amazing food, worst service in Chinatown.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "FOOD: The bossam is definitely worth getting. The medium is good for 3 to 4 people to share. The bossam is a steam pork belly dish where you wrap the meat with various pickled veggies. The napjak bulgogi is my favorite here. It is pretty much a bulgogi pancake and has a lot of flavor. I highly recommend the galbi tang, it is the best Korean soup with soft beef that falls off the bowl and clear noodles.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "DRINK: Free soda with check-in!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "SERVICE: The service here is horrible! They keep giving me the wrong orders and then they blame me saying I order the wrong thing. No accommodation whatsoever. The check came out and they also charged us for food we didn't order. Every time you ask for anything, the waiters have to check with their managers. I love their food, but I've been here multiple times and end up with problems each time.\n",
      "We tried this new place beacuse my mom saw it on newspaper ad. We were a party of 6 + 2 kids +baby. First off, they forgot 2 people's order. Everyone were done eating and when I asked abt the other food she said it will be out soon. It was obvious they forgot the order completely. We can see them in the back kitchen starting to make the food then as we can see through their glass window to the kitchen. Now on to the food.. the food was mediocre at best and we ordered a wide variety of items from soups to tonkatsu, and their pig feet with barbecue meat. The soup broth was very bland and tasted just watery. No flavor or broth that was prepared for hours to bring out delicious savory broth or something. Next, the tonkatsu was large but was not tasty. Lastly the pork feet and barbecue meat.. the meat smelled so badly we only ate a few bites and this was a large plate. So majority of it was a waste. We've had korean pig feet many many times. Hence, we know a good pig feet when we taste it. We even make it at the house sometimes. This was absolutely horrible! It was just a waste of $45. When cooked right, you shouldn't have a gross piggy aroma.. this dish did. Oh, one more thing they stuck us with automatic 18% gratuity even when they did not sit our party at the same table. Just wrong all over. We love trying new restaurants but this will be our first and only visit here.\n",
      "The food was decent.\r\n",
      "Had $26 combo.\r\n",
      "Compare to other all u can eat Korea bbq, I don't see anything better.\r\n",
      "The rib eye was good Kalbi was ok but just a order per table, not person which is weird.\r\n",
      "The ventilation thing was horrible, barely sucking the smog so they let the door open which was freezing.\r\n",
      "The lady with glasses at the counter was very unkind even rude.\r\n",
      "I probably won't go back there nor recommend to friends.\r\n",
      "Rather go to Biwon on Sahara or one in henderson\n",
      "This place was absolutely horrible. I am not quite certain how this place got 4/5. I may not have gotten their traditional samgyetang soup but paying $11 for a spicy soup with literally just beansprouts and 4 pieces of pork blood was absolutely absurd. The taste was not very good and the staff were not friendly. I would NOT go back.\n",
      "At the point of this review North Town Korean was four star rated but in a sea of Korean establishments along Yonge Street, their food  significantly pales in comparison.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We were there on a lazy Monday early evening. Their menu is quite limited in terms of options (with quite a few things stickered off as well) and hence we took a long time hemming and hawing on what to order. They had checked up on us quite a few times to see if we were ready to order but this would be their most attentive portion of their service unfortunately. Service was not good nor horrible. but I haven't spotted a smile on the server's face during the entire meal (I assume that was the owner).\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Food were very salty overall; expect to order a drink or go for one immediately after the meal. Quality is below average versus most competitors. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After ordering, a Korean pancake with onions and carrot was served on the house. The pancake was not bad but could still use a bit more crunch on the edges. It's on the house so no complaints.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Followed by the pork bone soup. The pork bone soup base felt like it came straight out of a NongShim instant noodle packet; rich in MSG and very SALTY! The pork bones generally lacked meat on all the pieces and they were not stewed well enough before they were served, meaning it made it extremely difficult to get the meat off the bone. Meat quality was also subpar; lacking the rich meaty taste that a proper gamjatang should have. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Soybean paste seafood soup was by far the best dish during the experience. The soup was very rich and had a savoury fermented soybean taste to it. Yet as with the theme of the night very SALTY! The seafood ratio relative to everything else, tofu and veggie, was also rather low.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Squid and pork belly bulgogi had a two chili warning on the menu and turned out to be the least spicy of all the dishes. As with the picture, looked spicy but was very mild in general. There was also way more pork belly than squid. Pork belly in general was overcooked and dry. It's certainly a skill to be able to take such a fat cut of meat and make it so dry. Again very SALTY!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Beef bulgogi was barely passable with a strong hint of ginger in the sauce. I'm not a big gimger guy so I didnt really enjoy it. The finish to the dish was also very runny. A good bulgogi hot plate should be relatively dry. Slighly SALTY!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So if this was a drinking game and every time you read the word SALTY in this food review and have to drink, you would naturally get some buzz. And to summarize...be prepared to order drinks and drink a lot if you are heading to North Town.\n",
      "Was there celebrating a birthday. The service was horrible from the hostess to the server to the bartender. It was my 1st (and last) time there, and I had some questions on the menu. The server was not knowledgeable and recommend the soft tofu, which I am now suffering from food poisoning.\n",
      "Accidentally ran into this one after visiting the Botanical Garden today. Ordered a beef kimchi toufu which was horrible-beef must be old and had a bite that actually tasted rotten. Rice must be left over from last night with chunks in the bowl.\n",
      "Clever name, but that's where it ends. I live very close to this place, so I figured it would be worth checking out. I love good Korean food, but when it's not done well, it sucks. This place is merely serviceable. Our leftovers were very stinky and the food wasn't good. The decor inside was unimpressive, but felt authentic for a hole-in-the-wall. The food isn't horrible, but I can't recommend it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Papago Plaza has a few gems, but sadly not everything there is awesome.\n",
      "don't waste your time going to this horrible place.  rude service at the front desk.  demanded tip from everyone, including take out item.  note website price is different than actual.  pork bone soup website price is $7.99 and actual price is $11.99.  when asked about the difference, she even denied having a website!  \\\\\r\n",
      "there's lots of other better korean restos out there.\n",
      "If I could, I would give this place negative stars. It's not Korean at all... even the tea served was Chinese. The service was horrible as tea was served once and never refilled despite the restaurant being empty and the waiter passing by multiple times. It also felt like a self serve restaurant, from choosing our own seats, requesting a menu and going up to pay because they took so long to pick up our cash. The katsu served was embarrassing. ..large thick pieces of pork that was already cut into chunks...definitely not the kind I've had at authentic restaurants. They also tried to cut corners by mixing purple rice with mushy, old chinese rice. The side dishes all tasted like there was a lack in flavour and complexity im used to at Korean places. I seriously wonder how this place stays in business.\n",
      "I was craving korean food my first night in toronto. We were looking for another korean restaurant and couldnt find it so we stopped by Nak Won instead. Bad choice! We arrived around 10pm and was told the restaurant closes at 11. We ordered kimchi fried rice and soon doo boo. We were told the kimchi fried rice came with pork but it did not. Also, the rice was very mushy and the kimchi tasted horrible. It is very hard to mess up on kimchi fried rice but this place succeeded. The soon doo boo was okay, nothing great. We were very tempted to leave after the first few bites. The service was also terrible. They were too focused on closing up the restaurant and not asking if we needed anything else. I would not recommend this place at all.\n",
      "The food here for the most part is very tasty. Tonight's 2 star rating is largely based on the absolutely horrible and unprofessional attitude of the cashier,also based on the fact that ALL OF THE COMBOS WERE NOT AVAILABLE on top of there being no Meat Jun.\n",
      "The servers are very nice, and attentive. But the food is not worth the price. The beef tongue, the beef, the pork,  the strawberry ice cream, and the mango pudding are probably the best things on the menu. I found that the marinade used for the chicken was lacking in flavor, and the sushi was abysmal. Probably the worst sushi I've ever had in my life. We ordered spicy salmon rolls, you could hardly taste the salmon and the panko surrounding the salmon was mushy rather than crunchy it was super unpleasant to eat. You can eat better sushi at Ocean's which is saying a lot. The last thing that was the icing on the cake was the fact that there is tip included in the bill, but according to the server that money does not go towards them. The servers are nice so I felt bad and put an additional tip on top, which basically turned into a 20 dollar tip in total. It wasn't a horrible experience but the quality of food did not reflect the price, which is what bothered me the most.\n",
      "The food is alright, it's a Korean BBQ place so the primary factor for me is the service. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The staff here are extremely annoying, condescending and incredibly slow. I only go here because it is bigger than most other Kbbq places so a large group of friends can get a table without a reservation fairly easily. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Decent food horrible service.\n",
      "Read as 3.5.The Korean barbeque portion is just like any other place but they have a great selection for dinner! The tiger shrimp is a must try! They are inconsistent with the thickness of their meat but overall it was good. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The sushi lacked in many places. The California rolls looked sloppy, the rice vinegar made the rice taste cheap, and their spicy salmon is bland mush - just to name a few things. The sushi portion wasn't horrible but they used low quality fish which really disappointed me. Would come back again maybe but not anytime soon.\n",
      "Let talk about the good things, \r\n",
      "The food tasted great WHEN it came \r\n",
      "the decor of the resturant was tasteful and it was a good enviroment\r\n",
      " \r\n",
      "However there were lots of negatives.\r\n",
      "First, the sushi that we ordered came when our bill came \r\n",
      "The hand rolls didn't come at all even though we called them multiple times\r\n",
      "The waiter had this horrible attitude\r\n",
      "The tips was included in the bill (which may be typical in many resturants but when you are getting this kind of crap service, thats forcing you to pay for service you didn't recieve)\r\n",
      "and we were kicked out of the resturant because we sat for longer then an hour\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Many would say that this is a good resturant but i would pass.\n",
      "Wow. Just wow. Maybe because I had a really really really low expectation of this place so I was pleasantly suprised by their quality and service. I have previously been to the Richmondhill location and it was just horrible but this location is a different story. We came here the sunday on easter weekend at 5:00 pm. The pricing waa $27.99 for dinner which includes the meat, their special items, and sushi. Their sushi were on point that day. Rice was warm and soft and the salmon was fresh. Their meat was quite flavourful as well especially their ox tongue which was amazing. A little salty because of the sauce but it goes so well with their side dishes especially their kimchi, pickled radish, and pickled cucumber. Salty and sour is just the perfect combination. Other items (lamb, salmon, shrimp, mussels, beef rib) were ok and fresh. Their weekend only steak was not bad at all. It wasnt thin and had great marbling. Of course you gotta finish with their grilled pineapples. Service was fast and they come by to check on you alot. All in all, this location is so much better than the one in rhill. Remember to make reservations on weekends cuz it can be super packed.\n",
      "Food is great but service is horrible. Tall white guy taking the orders was a complete jerk. We changed our order before we paid mind you and he freaked out. He took food out of our plate saying that they gave us to much then he didn't give us sides. Throw our box with food in it. There was a lady there before and I wish she was still there. I will make sure I tell people not to go when he is there\n",
      "Whoa.....downhill for sure in this update.  I was the first to review this new location and it's been a while since I went back because the waitress/owner gives such horrible service!  The food is good but I doubt we will be back because you just feel unwelcomed here -- like a nuisance.  Bleh, I can wait till I go home for some REAL Korean food (in Hawaii).  Where you can get some Mac salad too...lol!\n",

      "I've been here so many times. If you want authentic jajajangmyun this is the place to go. Service is horrible, my last visit, waitress totally screwed up the order. She sent out two dishes for a table of four. Instead of apologizing and promptly fixing the order she mumbles something and goes back to the kitchen. Needless to say we left half full as another order would have taken 30mins. My advice don't go when it's busy.\n",
      "If I could give 0 stars, I would. I typically do not write reviews but this experience was so horrible that that I just had to. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Food quality and portions have gone down significantly. Not sure if ownership has changed but I come here religiously, at least twice a month. They now serve half of what their portions used to be. Everything is drenched in oil and less flavourful. Not sure if this is a one off but everyone in our party had stomach aches when we finished dinner. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "What made this experience extra terrible is that the waitress forgot to hand in our order and we ended up waiting an hour for our food. Tables were coming, eating, and leaving before we got anything. In that hour, no one came to check up on us. After an hour, we approached the waitress and she found our order sitting on the side of the counter. Even after knowing we have been waiting so long, she didn't come bring the free apps that they offer with the meal. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When we received the bill, we asked if any discount can be applied as we had to wait so long. The owner came out to talk to us. I explained the situation and explained that we were loyal customers, he replied that if we were loyal customers we wouldn't be asking for a discount. He kept saying sorry but then would go on to say that an hour wait isn't even long during their rush hour hours (As mentioned, I'm a religious customer and I've only ever had to wait 25 mins max even when their restaurant was slammed). He started yelling at me and I even had to say not to raise his voice at me as I didn't want to argue further. He ended up giving us a $5 discount but made it clear he was really upset about offering us a discount. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Stay far away from here. This restaurant has fallen off. Plenty of other Korean gems on Bloor st.\n",
      "The food was good and timely but the waitress we had was horrible. She didn't verbally respond when we told her how many people were in the party (3) and also didn't respond when we ordered and just took the menus from us. Definitely recommend this location for takeout but not dine in because of the one waitress.\n",
      "The food was good but the service needs to be better\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Went there last night with a big party and the service has gone down hill.  \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "First the water jugs was empty and no one came to refill it, considering we had 2 people cooking at our table because we had a big party, its weird that no one notice the water containers was empty. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Second, at one point the heat was up so high on one of our grills that the smoke was going right in to the face of 2 of our friends. This went on for like 5 min before i pulled the ventilator down closer to the food to stop the  the smoke.  So the waiter comes back, sees the the ventilator low and pulls it back up to continue cooking.  So after he pulls it back up the smoke starts going to the faces of my friends again. They were obviously waving their hands in front of their faces to get rid of the smoke. It was pork belly so the smoke was crazy... this goes on for another 5 min before the waiter realized what was going on and turned down the fire.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So after he turned down the fire and the pork belly coarse was done he tossed on the next pork dish.  So after he tossed it on, he never turned the fire back up.  So after 10 min of drinking and chatting with my friends i realize the the pork was not cooking at all and completely raw still.  \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At this time i had to wave down another waiter to come and turn the fire back up so our food can continue to cook.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After they tuned the fire back up and finished cooking, they never stopped by to check on our waters and basically we had to flag someone down if we wanted anything because no one came and checked on us. \r\n",

      "All in all it wasn't a horrible experience, the food was good but the service was just so-so.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I took one star away for the smoke and raw meat on the grill for 10 min fiasco and another star for lack of attention after the meats were cooked.\n",
      "First of all let me say that a lot of people like to rant when they are displeased with a business. It's only fair to let the owners know when their expectations are blown away. I've had Korean BBQ one time and it was horrible. That was about 5 years ago. Never tried another place after that. Tonight was absolutely a surprise. We visited this restaurant as a recommendation of a friend. Who's one of the best chefs I know. Everyone must try this restaurant. Food was absolutely excellent and a huge surprise. Our server and grill master was Bora. A true asset to this business! When you come ask for her tables. Employees make or break any business. Repeat customers from this day forward.\n",
      "Overall bad service! We walked in and waited 15 min and there's no one to take order. The water bottle they served is horrible! Top lid is covered with dirt and they don't even bother to clean it off. Then when we think they are coming to take our order, but instead they took order for the other table who came in after us! We walked out immediately and I'll never come back to this place ever again!!!!\n",
      "Absolutely horrible service. Not only did we wait for an extended period of time to get in. We watched numerous people of Asian decent avoid the line of white people and go straight to the dining room. Upon finally getting a seat we were handed a menu to pick from for the all you can eat which was only restricted to a set number of orders per time. Our food took over 45 minutes to arrive and was served in extremely small portions despite requesting more. When walking around other tables with Asian people sitting at them had food stacked from one end to another while white peoples tables were constantly bare. All in all we spent 120$ for 4 people to eat and left hungry. When we asked to speak to a manager all the employees told us they don't have a manager and there was no superior. They did not make an effort to resolve the matter and instead shrugged their shoulders.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Horrible service, extremely long wait times and an obvious prejudice opinion towards white People ruins any hope of me returning.혻\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I highly suggest thinking twice before dining at this restaurant. Much better ways to spend your money.\n",
      "Husband and I wanted to try this place when we saw it driving up Rainbow.  Went today and I have to say it was not the best experience.  The food was good - fresh, large portions.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The staff sucked.  When we walked in, the larger, purple haired girl had the register open (apparently trying to balance it) and didn't even look up to greet us.  Acted like we didn't exist.  The other girl working there, was sitting at a customer table with some guy.  Pringles and other snacks were being consumed and they were watching videos on their phones.  She finally gets up and helps us.  She was friendly enough.  The other girl finished what she was doing in the register and continued to do whatever it is she does with a scowl on her face.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Got our food and it was fresh, hot and very good.  However, the restaurant itself is a wreck.  Floors were dirty, tables were dirty and nobody seemed to care.  We sat down and the girl that helped us went back to sit with her friend at the table with snacks.  She then proceeded to start a video that had a good portion of f bombs in it.  I don't care but if children were there, I'd be pissed.  \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Bottom line - food is good, staff is horrible, place needs a good cleaning.  If I were the franchise owner, I would fire all of them and start new.  I don't give this place very long before they go out of business unless some major changes are made.\n",
      "If you want to be stereotyped, have a horrible dinner, and leave with a bad taste in your mouth go here it will be perfect! Its far from the good service in the other China Town restaurants in the surrounding areas. We will make sure we will never go here and will warn others that we know that this place is an utter waste of time and money! Immediately when me and my husband got there we were told to wait so that they can clean the tables for us. But we encountered 3 couples that spoke fluent Korean that were being seated in front of us in the seats that we saw were empty before we even got there! The place was about half full when we got there, about 7:00 p.m. on Thursday of January 10. \r\n",
      "Eventually, we got noticed and got seated in a seat that had been empty before we were even there. It says alot about the service there. We have a waiter that gives us the least amount of attention in which we notice the excellent customer servicer he is giving to others around us. I have had to turn over my own food on the grill and at this point I really just want to head home. We were seated right at the front and seeing other customers being seated right away made my blood boil.We were really the only ones that had to wait. Burnt food, horrible customer service, stereotyping, u are a fool to go here. Spend at least 100 bucks here to feel like u should of been on the strip. I recommend any visitors or anybody living in this area to don't waste your time or money here.\n",
      "I would give a negative star but  a minimum of one star is required . My husband and I are an interracial couple who received horrible service and were discriminated against at this establishment. At 12 o'clock in the afternoon the waitress told us we could not order from the lunch menu, only the dinner menu. A Korean couple came in 30 minutes after us, and had received their food 15 minutes before us. When our food arrived the soup was bland, the waitress never checked with us and didn't even bring our bill. At check out, the owner added a five dollar tip on our bill, I had inquired about why the five dollars that were added, and she told me that every table has to pay tips. We left the tip on the table already despite the lack of service we had received. Some of my friends went to the same restaurant and they had a $10 tip added to their bill because they had four people. I would never go back to this restaurant and I will do my best to inform my terrible experience to anyone who is a minority and thinking about eating at this establishment.\n",
      "By far the worst Korean food I have ever had.The environment felt dirty the meat smelt spoiled and just not good at all. Very sketchy and just horrible.\n",
      "This place does not deserve even 1 star! Don't ever go here!! We are a party of 9, they could not accommodate us w/seating together w/the grill. So we sat at 2 separate tables! Keep my review short...the bill came out w/gratuity INCLUDED of $60!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WTF?! On top of that, service was horrible! They only gave us 5 side dishes! Very little meat! Urgh!!! I never minded paying hundreds for our meal but our bill of $397 was sooooo NOT worth it!\n",
      "This place is located in China Town of Las Vegas. The food here taste no different than a regular Korean restaurant. I paid $20 for Korean Beef and I was at least expecting that it would make me full but the dish was so small I would of have to order two more dish to be full. \r\n",
      "I also tried cooking ribs for myself and it cost $30 and they only give you two ribs that are the size of a small candy bar. \r\n",
      "They force you to pay 20% tip for their poor services too. Overall, this place is horrible and it's only to lure tourist in. \r\n",
      "If I were to go back to my own city, San Francisco, this lunch would of cost me less than $10 per person. My family of 4 spent $120 on lunch here and would of spent $30 at home. The price difference and the amount of food they give out is not fair. Horrible mistake to eat here.\n",
      "To pay $39.50/person because we wanted the steamed egg and not only have the server forget to put the order in, but to bring us out an old and turning grey cut of meat was an utter disappointment! We also asked for more salt and oil which she forgot to bring it, so I had to share mine with boyfriend! NEVER coming back here again!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "An hour later we both had mothers revenge and are both in the bathroom, this is horrible!\n",
      "Worse dining experience I've ever had. Waited for a grill table and was explained the menu wrong and couldn't change my order either after I put it in minutes later learning what the waitress told me wasn't correct. Paid 50 dollars for some fatty beef soup and horrible side dishes.  I wouldn't recommended this to anyone if it was free. You couldn't pay me to eat here again.\n",
      "If you like to be chased outside because they feel like you didn't give them enough tip, then this is the perfect place for you. 3$ tip for a 25$ total price of the food we ate is not bad. Plus the service is horrible. It's like playing hide and seek with the food server. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.\n",
      "3.5 stars\r\n",
      "The food is good but my only really horrible gripe is the noodle soup lunch special. $8.50 FOR NOODLES,SALTY SOUP AND 1 PIECE OF POTATO REALLY!!!\n",
      "Got white cheese jimdak with additional cheese rice cake as topping. Got exactly 3 additional cheese rice cake for $1.99 I would not recommend adding topping. Food was good though. Also bad customer service. I was about to say that 3 rice cake for $1.99 is horrible and she didn't even listen to me walked away\n",
      "The service was horrible. Not very packed for a newly opened location. I came with a friend on Tuesday evening to see if it tastes as good as the other location but it seemed to be worse. We ordered the green onion classic but it does not say that they use horseradish in the sauce. I'm allergic and have tried this dish many times at various korean fried chicken places but this is the first location with horseradish. So of course, it's a huge dish worth $32 and I can eat it after the first bite. I tell the server and they said that they can't do anything about it. I then ask for the owner and she said it was my fault for ordering it. Upset, I tell them, my situation and eventually after several minutes the owner finally asks what I want instead. We switched to the spicy chicken but the sauce was super thick which made the chicken soggy halfway through. \r\n",
      "I've also noticed that servers don't come often to check up nor give water refills unless you ask of it after struggling to get their attention - this wasn't just my table but all tables around us. I much rather go to the other location or just simply stick with the Fry.\n",
      "I was craving Korean BBq and my friend told me about this place, it was horrible! I am half korean, growing up in Southern California and eating korean food for 30 years I think I know my korean..lol for starters the meats were bland, and not fresh looking. The selection at lunch was a few mystery potato salads, mystery noodles, and some other fried items. There was only one kimchee, no cucumber kimchee or bean sprouts. I will say that the bulgogi was ok so I ended up eating lettuce wraps with bean paste and bulgogi. I went during lunch so I don't know if dinner is better, but if you like bland meat and potato salad..this is for you...\n",
      "Okay Im a sucker for AYCE Korean BBQ. As much as I care about the price, the taste is like 100x more important. Service was okay, since I was Korean the waiter just waited for me to call him for drinks and to change out the grill (which you must change out the grill once you grill marinated meat so the rest of your meat doesnt burn). Wooche charges only $19.99 for dinner. The banchan (Korean side dishes) were absolutely horrible! Not that it wasn't edible, but so many random dishes like assortment of Chinese dishes that you can tell was sitting in for a long, long time... The egg roll & potstickers were like hockey pucks, the beef and broccoli were shriveled up in the sauce. They only Korean banchan they had was lots of namul (vegetable dishes). Really? A Korean BBQ done properly should either be expensive (~$25) and have tons of great tasting banchan, desserts, and meat OR have it for cheap (~$15) and have a few, but great tasting banchan. I really dont know if corn out of a can & mushy cucumber kimchi is necessary to fill the space. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now onto the meats, at WooChe you can find chicken, pork, and beef plain, marinated in either soy or hot pepper paste. They also have an assortment of spicy baby octopus and shrimp with the shell and head on. I am sensitive when it comes to the gaminess of the meat and as soon as I put the pork belly and beef steak into my mouth I tasted something really unpleasant... Sadly the only meat that comes to mediocre is the kalbi. After 7:00 had passed, a lot of Korean people were coming in to eat & drink. A lady from the kitchen brought out raw, spicy blue crab. The seasonings were mainly red pepper paste with jalapenos, sugar, and sesame oil... nothing great. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My boyfriend and I are always willing to give places 3 or 4 tries, but this was a total no-go... We will stick to either Tofu Huts AYCE Happy Hour $13.99 (great for simple pork belly, beef brisket, or spicy pork belly with excellent salad) or Honey Pig AYCE $24.99 (same table side service like Tofu Hut, but the quality of meat, banchan, and service is great)!!!\n",
      "I ordered a bowl of cold noodle, and it was the most horrible cold noodle I've ever had. The soup is water I suppose. Few saut챕ed beef in it. And there was no kimchi in it. Instead, they put some weird Chinese pickled turnips in it, and it smells like fart (no offence I've had great Chinese pickle before). I only paid 50cents for tips, and the cashier seemed so angry but whatever I'll never go again.\r\n",
      "Another experience I had here earlier, for kimchi bibimbap (saut챕ed kimchi with rice). The rice seemed to be over nights and it stuck together, the interior of the stuck rice ball is cold. I should've not come here the second time, but I made a huge mistake to give it another chance.\n",
      "worst restaurant I've ever been in my life... The service was out of this world (in a bad way), the food was unexpectedly horrible, one of my friend didn't get his order until the end (he didn't even want to ask for it, he just never had his food)... I may sound harsh, but I went with a group of friend and our night flopped because of this really bad experience...The food was not worth the price at all..\n",
      "This place had typical Korean food. But the service was horrible. I with I could give a zero star because they treated us like we were bothering them. We ordered spicy soup but my friend doesn't eat spicy so we asked if we could change. She said no rudely. Then later, our rice was poorly cooked so we asked for them to re make it. But she just microwaved it and also gave us a bad attitude. Later, I heard her  talking behind our backs saying we were causing trouble for them. Other things we asked for like bowls and chopsticks were given rudely to us. Overall, I was very displeased with the service and therefore will never come back ever\n",
      "Do yourself a favour and visit any other Korean restaurant at FMP. The only reason why you would come to this restaurant is if you're up for serving yourself. Though considering all stories about finding extra protein (a.k.a insects) in food, you might want to extend that reason to include self-cooking. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I came here the first time with a friend to have an early dinner. We sat ourselves down (because no server came to seat us) and proceeded to press the button to call for waiter. What a surprise - it was broken. Thinking we were extremely clever, we pressed the button on the unoccupied table next to us. What a surprise - no waiter came. After waving foolishly for fifteen minutes, a disgruntled women came and took our orders begrudgingly. We had to beg her to give us tea and side dishes. We both ordered gamgatang, but what came to our tables appeared to be spicy water with a heap of skimpy bones. Trying to mask the lack of taste, the chefs evidently overspiced it, which called for the need of multiple glasses of cold water. Another horrible surprise - the waiter never came to give us any even when we asked. Our tea ran out before our food came and it remained empty until we left. Our server looked as if she was ready to clobber the living daylights out of us when we paid in cash. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My second visit was much worse. No side dishes until we were halfway through our meal. When we pressed the button, the waiters retreated to the back of the restaurant and disappeared for a good twenty minutes. My friends soontofu looked like it had already made a journey to and back from the chef's own stomach. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Needless to say, I felt happy when I left no tips, or rather, a penny and a scathing note. In fact, I was elated.\n",
      "I have been to many Nak Won restaurants across the Greater Toronto Area, but this location at First Markham Place has to be the WORST. I've been to this location for many years but I realized that their service and food is going downhill. Also, I think this place is way too understaffed for a Saturday night. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To start off, we got seated quickly and the waitress threw the menus onto the table... okay.. not off to a good start. Many waitresses walked by us with no smiles and didn't even bother glancing at our table. Didn't even bother asking if we wanted to order yet, also didn't give us any utensils/tea. \r\n",
      "Took them 20 minutes to actually come and take our order. We even had to request for tea and utensils. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The food came within a reasonable time (I give them one star for that) but the food was okay. Eh, you can get better Korean food elsewhere. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When we wanted to get the bill, for some reason, they brought the bill over really quickly. No one came to get our payment, so I decided to go up to the counter to pay. The waitress up front started yelling at me if I wanted change and gave me a ton of attitude. Also, I asked if I could get a takeout box.. bu she proceeded to yell at me to get the box myself. I have never experienced such horrible service at any establishment in Markham.\n",
      "This place is a solid 3 star...and that is a compliment from before. In the past, this place has had mediocre food and horrible service; grumpy servers, unconventional rules and rude comments. The last time I unwillingly came, I was pleasantly surprised by a lack of rudeness.\r\n",
      "And this visit was the same. Ignoring the past (which is difficult to do), I agree with other reviews that the food is acceptable.\r\n",
      "Coming in, I expected a quick dinner of gamjatang for myself and kimchi jigae for my wife, a combination that we have had a million times the world over. And we were not disappointed because we expected the msg taste in the broth and minimal interaction with the staff. I was pleasantly surprise with 7 side dishes and no problems with the refills.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Solid 3 stars if nothing else changes. However, I would only come here if Food Express in the food court was closed and I didn't want to drive to Yonge St.\n",

      "No lies, I've been avoiding this place because of the horrible Yelp rating and the fact that they don't seem to have any way to get rid of the smoke and heat from the BBQ's as most AYCE Korean Grill restaurants do. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We were sat in the fairly empty restaurant on a weeknight. They chose the table with a giant burned section smack in the middle. It was uneven and the worst part wasn't even the burned look (as you can see in the photo). It's the gross stuff caught under the burnt tiles. It's just so unsanitary and it would be an easy/cheap fix to just rip that stuff off and cover it back up. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Anyway, moving onto the food. I actually didn't catch any photos because we were apparently too hungry and just chowed right down. I really enjoyed the banchans they offered. Especially the pickled cucumbers. And I love that you pretty much get as many refills as you'd like because they only put 4-5 pieces per bowl. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We ordered a couple soups, bulgogi beef with rice, and one of their creamy black bean sauce noodles. The soups were great. Good flavour and lots of hardy meat to eat. So if we ever came back here, that's probably my top pick. The rest was a bit of a let down. The bulgogi was virtually flavourless and price was rather high for something so dry and tasteless. The noodles were good but their black bean sauce is very runny. It was definitely not creamy.. But I know many places make theirs differently and perhaps I just didn't prefer this location's version of this noodle.  Servers we had were very friendly though, but just a big hard to get their attention sometimes. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Over all, we have a lot more Korean food choices we can go to in the area. So I wouldn't think I'd be back. It wasn't horrible, but it just wasn't a great experience when you combine the food and the atmosphere.\n",
      "Food was so-so. We ordered the all you can eat BBQ, we kept asking them to bring our 2nd round of food, it took them over 30 minutes to bring 2 plates of raw kalbi. How long does it take to prepare raw food? The waitress definitely forgot about it, more than once. Needless to say our 2 hour was up and we didn't even have a 3rd round of food. We both paid over $56 + tax of food and at the end we didn't even get a chance to eat our worth. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Service was horrible, we tipped them with whatever the change came back with because got next-to-nothing service. At the end the waitress asked us to tip them 10% and when we didn't want to, she then said we need to respect her and made a scene in front of several other customers. Where was our, the customer's, respect? We left the place unhappy, and empty feeling.\n",
      "The positive reviews for this place are absolutely astounding.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I came here with a large party of people on a Sunday night. Something that, you would think, huge restaurants like Nak Won would be used to by now. They also fool you into thinking they have some sort of logical system of serving, with the electronic bells on the tables that I love. Yes, you can press them to your heart's content and even see your table number flashing on the giant LOST-like screen at the counter but your beeps will fall on deaf ears.... not once did the servers look up at the screen or even register that a bell was being pushed. Handwaving, dirty looks and even standing up to gesture to a server was to no avail. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Aside from Magic Wok, who I would say share the dubious distinction of SLOWEST AND MOST INCOMPETENT WAIT STAFF IN MAKRHAM (C), Nak Won is the worst place in the universe to eat if you want to be treated like a normal, paying customer (and/or human being).\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It took literally 15 minutes to flag down a server to get a menu; another 15 to get them back in order to give them our order; 45 minutes to get our food; various sprinklings of 10-15 minutes in order to refill banchan (the side dishes) or get water, or a drink, etc,; and we actually waited so long for them to bring our cheque that I decided to bring it up to the counter to save everyone involved some misery. They seemed neither surprised nor repentent that their service was so shambolic that I had to do their work for them. The true mark of a horrible restaurant. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "You might think this hyperbole, but really, what else are you going to a certain restaurant for other than being served well? All the Korean food available here can be found elsewhere for the same price and same or better quality. To think that there are still restaurant owners who don't understand the value of good customer service is beyond me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oh yeah, the food itself was nothing to write home about. The kalbi was overly-chewy, the kamjatang was watery and merely dosed over with spice, and so on. Amazing Korean food you will not find here.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It's a shame the Shanghainese restaurant that used to occupy this space is now gone because they had a good thing going. I cannot wait until Nak Won shuts down and shoves off to the Elephant Graveyard.\n",

      "The service is just horrible. I eat a lot of Asian food so I am use to bad or non existent service, but this place is the worst of them all. The servers just waves her hand at us asking how many in an extremely rude way. While we were taking off our jackets and sitting down she just slams the menu on the table. After a few minutes we asked a different server to take our order, she didn't even ask us if we wanted the pork bone soup hot or mild. Before we could even tell her she ran off. Good thing she came back a minute later with the side dishes. We told her we wanted the soup to be spicy and she didn't even reply with a nod or yes. When we asked for a few extra bowls for sharing she kissed her teeth at us. Uhm, really? The worst part is, the place wasn't even full and when we were just finished the server slammed the bill on our table. I understand this is a Korean thing and I usually have no problems paying up and leaving if the place is packed and busy, but there was 5 other small tables that were empty! \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now let's talk about the disgusting side dishes. They have trays and trays of these side dishes already dished out and sitting on the counter uncovered for who knows how long. I find it extremely unsanitary and off putting especially when its the same direction as the washroom. The salad was just bad, the lettuce wilted and it was overdressed to the point that the dressing was falling off the lettuce when u try to eat it. The Kimchi was dry because it was sitting in the open for too long. The seaweed has a weird taste. Everything else was either overdressed or just tasted bad. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Kalbi was great, juicy, tender and good taste. Love the onions on the hot plate with a touch of sauce. Great when eaten with the rice. Would've been better if the side dishes were just as good. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Pork Bone soup is just bland and boring. We ordered the spicy so at least it had some heat to it. 1 piece of potato. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Bibimbap, this is one of those dishes u really can't mess up because it's just veggies, some meat, rice and hot sauce. While it's not bad, it's really not that great either. I've had better at other places and had the side dishes been better this dish would've tasted better with the sour veggies or kimchi. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I suggest to go to Owl of Minerva next door since their pork bone soup is much better and their service isn't bad either. All in all, I will not come back to this place for their bad service and bad food.\n",
      "Their food was at good quality and up to my standards. But the customer service was like a JOKE! I have never been so mad about a restaurant service before. My girlfriend and I waited more than 10 mins just for water. The worst part was when we were paying for the bill. The total came up at $27.24. I was already nice enough to put down $30.00 and the rest as tips for the horrible service. The lady came up to me and said that there is not enough tip. I was in shock! She gave me a rude look and walked away. If you want to be treated like a dog, this is the place to go....\n",
      "I stopped here while on a trip recently. We only ordered sushi... while not horrible, I feel like the quality was very poor compared to any of my local places yet more expensive than what I'm used to. This could be just the prices in the area; I'm from a smaller city.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The rolls were big and very filling. The presentation was decent and service was good... but I definitely won't return if I come back through Pittsburgh. I prefer a higher quality sushi and I've made better rolls at home.\n",
      "If you're in the mood for fresh, tasty sushi, this is not the place for you. The food that was delivered to us was simply inedible. Point blank. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My husband and I ordered a bunch of sushi for dinner with the plan of having tasty leftovers for lunch the next day, so we splurged a little, spent like $60 on various rolls. The presentation was pretty pathetic - wilting nori, leading us to believe these rolls were pre-made; hot pink ginger, meaning it's the MSG-soaked kind; glue-like rice, where you can't see the individual grains - but what really horrible was the smell. When we took the lid off the tray, the stench of rotten fish knocked both if us back. I honestly gagged.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was so awful, we just stared at each other, amazed that we just spent our money on a pile of stinking rot. Determined to not waste everything, I picked up a piece of spider roll to sniff/inspect/try. IT HAD A HUGE HAIR IN IT, all wound around the crab. Totally disgusting. My husband attempted to try the inari - just tofu and rice, right? It tasted like rotten fish, as it had absorbed all the smells from the other fish rolls. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We had also ordered a vegetable and tofu soup, and a green salad with ginger dressing. Can't even believe this, but the salad leaves were brown and slimy on the ends! They actually screwed up a green salad. The soup tasted like the inside of an aluminum pot, all metallic and burnt-flavored. Horrible, horrible, horrible. We literally dumped everything down the garbage disposal. Total waste.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We tried to call and complain, but by the time our order was delivered, the place was closed. We will be calling again today to get our money back. Maybe they will earn themselves another star if they do the right thing and refund our money.\n",
      "Man... Really bad from start to finish. Service is slow and horrible. Sushi is not flavorful at all. The rice was some of the worst I have ever had. I honestly would rather eat day old gas station sushi than come here again.\n",
      "Quality of their meat was horrible!\r\n",
      "My husband is korean and he said that was the worst food he ever had\n",
      "I've eaten at Chowon about 10 times now, but in all but one visit, have only ever ordered the same dish. That would be the kamponggi, which is a korean style sweet-n-sour chicken.  This place makes an amazing kamponggi and the $13 dish can easily feed 2 or 3 people.  We usually order a bowl of rice each to go with it.  \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I just went there again on Saturday at 1pm for lunch and we decided to order a second dish since there were 4 of us there this time and settled on a seafood casserole (haemul jeongol for $20) . That was a mistake. Sure, the plate was gigantic... but it was a huge mound of soybean sprouts!! There was an okay amount of seafood mixed in here and there, but honestly... gigantic plate of beansprouts.  The kamponggi was also soggy beneath all the sauce... usually it's crispy, even with the sauce on top of it. \r\n",
      "Service was horrible on this day, the lady who served us seemed to hate us, dropped off food and turned away so fast we could barely ask for stuff, ignored our bell, didn't bring us rice until 15 mins after we got our kamponggi, and took the menu away .. while my friend was reading it o_O Could be because we were the only ones in there not speaking Korean?  I was super embarassed since I had touted this place so much and it was their first time there *SIGH*\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "All the other times, I'd gone on a Sunday lunch with a friend.. right when they open at 12 and was served by another lady who was always nice to us. I'm not going to pan them for the last visit, and I just love their kamponggi too much BUT will stick to going on a Sunday as before!!\n",
      "Place smells great, horrible service on the weekend. Had a simple order that took 30 mins to handle. Half of our party was served, half of our party was not. More staff needed for busy hours. Food turned out to incredible, overall was worth the wait. This would be a five star review if the service was better. Will return.\n",
      "Some great food. Interesting vibe. Great service.  Not so much family friendly. A little pricey.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ok here's what I liked. The crispy pork belly! Omg so good. I do however wish they had additional sauces that weren't spicy. But the pork was amazing and the sauce it did come with was tasty, just a tad on the spicy side. The  sweet potato bird's nest was tasty! My husband enjoyed the loaded mashed potato salad. I can appreciate it's uniqueness but it wasn't my fave. Mostly because I don't care for cucumbers and it has their house pickled cucumbers in it and they were bigger chunks and I didn't care for the texture. But I wouldn't say it was bad.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As far as family friendly. Well not with smaller kids or picky kids. There is not a lot of selection of non spicy items. All the items are unique, which we enjoy trying new things but our 5yo was not so interested. Also, the TV's are playing some Asian pop music videos but they are pretty risque. So not so appropriate for a little one. I kept trying to avert his attention. That being said I would maybe come back I just wouldn't bring little ones. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "What I really didn't like... The ramen and cheese. Yuck gag. It was horrible. Sorry, but I really hated it. Even the 5yo who loves Mac and cheese and any kind of noodles wasn't interested. Also, it was a little on the pricey side in general. ..\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I would still recommend the place with no kids and no ramen.\n",
      "Heard great things, horrible experience. My BF tried to order a beer with his green card (a government issued ID with a photo... which is what is required to serve alcohol) and they refused. Not only did they refuse, the server stood there staring at his card like she had never even heard of a green card. Food was dry, tasteless and awful. Left both of us with an upset stomach and my boyfriend very frustrated they refused to serve him.\n",
      "First time here we had a blast! Second time, not so much. We called as soon as they opened to pick up an order. After waiting 45min for food that they said would only take 15min, they offered us the food for free since their card reader would not work. They then decided to make us wait longer while the fixed the problem and then went back on their offer, and charged us full price. Good food, horrible service. Never going back!\n",
      "If you're going for the food, the wings are amazing and our server was decent (although he seemed a bit annoyed). \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "If you're going for karaoke, please keep reading. They only book each room once per night, very inefficient. We checked in for our 6pm birthday dinner reservation and were put on the wait list for karaoke, we were #3. I should mention they they don't do anything special for birthdays at all. We finish dinner at 8pm, check on update on karaoke and we're still third. Ok, we proceed to enjoy corn hole outside while we wait. At 9:05pm one of their reservations that was at 8:45 was 20 minutes late surpassing the grace period of 15 minutes and we were supposed to get the room. However, they showed up and we were told we'd get a room soon. Lies. We were told at 10pm another room was paying out, however we didn't get a call until 11:15pm. Yes, we were on the wait list for 5 hours and 15 minutes. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Why have a reservation at 8:45pm and hold the room when it can be booked 6-8pm? One booking a day per room is ridiculous. It's a cool spot, decent food, dog friendly, but the customer service and management needs improvement. Please allow multiple karaoke reservations for blocks of time on the future.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Parking here is horrible.\n",
      "The service was horrible. I mean really really horrible. I gave 1 extra star just because these guys must be exhausted from shoveling raw meat at people all day. I'm sooooo full so I guess that counts as a close fail in my books. Like they say, close is only good in horseshoes and hand grenades.\n",
      "I guess this place got a lot of complaints about their horrible service because the service we got was EXCELLENT.. I went for lunch with me family and we had 10 people.. We must have asked for more food every 10 minutes and it came promptly every time.. And on top of that the manager (or someone of high authority) came around at the end to make sure everything was good.. He even cracked a joke which was lame but nice of him..  The food was really really good.. The short ribs were the best I've ever had because they were cut so thick! \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The downfalls, the bean spouts (usually one of my fave sides) was disgusting.. We all had one bite and it was gross.. They used a plastic water can while cleaning the grill.. Kinda weird.. Lastly CHECK YOUR BILL!!!!!!!!! TIP IS INCLUDED!!!!!!!!!  Although they were nice about giving us the money back\n",
      "This is my 4th time coming but I don't think I'll ever come back again. The good is that the food is above average. It's seasoned well but definitely loaded with MSG and sodium so be careful. The sushi for dinner time is like your grocery store sushi nothing to rave about at all but fun to have at the Korean BBQ place. Two things that were really bad was:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "1. Horrible horrible ventilation to the point where the smoke was burning my eyes. The Korean Grill House downtown is smaller and more congested and doesn't even have the problem. It makes it difficult to enjoy the meal and I usually don't mind that much smoke. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "2. The biggest thing I had a problem was with the TIP situation. They add on 12% automatically to your bill no matter the party size and the our waiter pushed us to tip more and when we didn't tip the amount he wanted he asked us why and put one of our friends on the spot which was unprofessional and awkward. He kept asking why?not good service? Not good food? What's wrong with us?? He said the 12% only goes to front of the house and the kitchen and less than 1% for himself. If this is the truth then this place needs to be reported to the labour authorities of Ontario because that's not right. I will never come back here because this is shady business etiquette and I don't respect that at all and I'll be telling others that ever mention this place. I don't blame the waiter I blame the restaurant owners. How disgusting.\n",
      "ABSOLUTELY DESPICABLE! The food is ok. Beef ribs are a must but unfortunately this random 10% charge that you get included with your bill (it was only 2 of us) is definitely a slap in the face. I was rulectanly dining here for my second time after my first horrible experience when we felt forcably removed from the restaurant to 'free up space' which was basically empty. Even though we were a party of 7 that spent over 300 dollars there and spent any less than the allotted 2 hour dining limit. All this after just recieving our icecream. This wasn't some server it was the manager. Who was also taking things off the table that done with. Now back to the last visit. Not only does this insane charge come up but now I've got to tip the server? Which I did because he was awesome! I work in the restaurant industry and this is insane. Worst part is we dont even drink! We had 2 pops and our meals and the bill was almost 95 dollars! THIS IS NOT RIGHT. I would of much rather spent 40 dollars more for the keg. At least I would feel like I got my money's worth. AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COST!\n",
      "Went in here for a double date! Easy to find, clean and no shortage of parking space. Stress free coming into the restaurant.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The place didn't seem busy for a Friday night, lots of seating and lots of servers, but this is where my experience goes downhill.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The food is the same as every other Korean BBQ grill House, unlimited rice with  side dishes that consist of Kimchee, Tofu, radish, potato, etc. and Meats that consist of pork, short ribs, chicken, shrimp, ox tongue, etc. Also, they now serve sushi with the dinner price.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "First round was basic, they bring out everything and everything looks good. However, by the time we order our second round and third round the service for our table went downhill. They missed our orders, bringing the wrong items and consistently have to wave waiters and ask them politely to remember our request. At one point, we asked for 1 tray of vegetables and shrimps, they came back with 4 trays of mushrooms! What do we do with 4 trays of mushroom?!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I cannot comment on the meat, since we cooked it. The sushi was not to par at all, of what sushi has to be. You are better off buying at Metro instead of paying 25 dollars here. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This experience was horrible. It's too bad that it's that Mississauga location is the bad one. I love the Chako in the Richmond Hill area.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The only positive in this experience is that, they do cheaper deals for late night goers. Extra star!\n",
      "It was a Very horrible restaurant, the food wasn't good and inside it doesn't have proper ventilation and they where very dishonest about their advertisements. If you pay cash on the same bill They give 5% discount but for adult only not for children and senior. They never mentioned on their advertisements.\n",
      "Came here after dinner for a drink with a friend. The service was horrible. We wait 20 minutes for them to bring a menu. Didnt get a chance to try the food, maybe next time.\n",
      "Used to be my local spot to grab food, but something has changed. Food that's not hotpot is relatively good but their service has gone down significantly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Incredibly rude female servers who made a decision to get orders from other tables (we ordered hotpot as well) as sat forever getting serious side eye.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When we finally got the hotpot it was horrible, and this wasn't my first time here or having it. Lack of flavour, lack of care and horrific service resulted in me not going and my consistent need to provide other recommendations so people wouldn't have to go through what we did.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "1 star was the lowest Yelp would go\n",
      "Let me start this review by saying that if it wasn't for this establishment opening until 2:45am, my boyfriend and i would have never went. & this establishment is pretty much racist if your not Korean or Caucasian. Save your money don't come here.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I was visiting Toronto when we stopped at Vapor Central (aaaamazing smoke lounge). We were pretty hungry on a Saturday night but not much is open late unlike NYC. I found Miss Korea on yelp and was interested in the cuisine and nor importantly, it was opened late. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To begin the horrific experience we had, when we walked in, we were ignored by the staff who pushed around us and acted like they couldn't understand that we were asking for a table for 2. After getting seated, our waiter disappears for about 15 mins leaving us unsure on what the service would be. When the waiter returned, she was very pushy and did not spend any time explaining the menu that was mostly in Korean. After finally deciding on the chicken wings and the beef (the combos that come with a drink), our waiter returns with our drinks. To begin, the plum wine is absolutely disgusting. It literally tastes like you're drinking perfume, absolutely horrible. After trying to get our waiters attention for about 10 mins I made my way to be back counter/kitchen when i asked to have my drink replaced or returned because i was not going to drink it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Again i was pushed around by the staff who again acted like they couldn't understand my english. i was told that they could not replace but would offer me another drink. by the time we got back to the table, my waiter informed me that i would have to pay full price for a new drink, NO WAY IN HELL. so i decided to keep the perfume flavored drink and drink 1/2 of my boyfriends 4 Molsens.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "after waiting for our food for another 25 mins, the waiter only comes back with my boyfriends chicken wings, my food is still MIA. After another 15-20 mins, my boyfriend has eaten his entire meal and mine still is yet to arrive. Fed up once again, i go to the back counter and ask where my food was, to my surprise the order was never rung up.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At this point I'm ready to leave. The restaurant offered to get me a to go place which i accepted but there was no comp for their forgetfulness. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This establishment is rude, disgusting, racist, and over priced. Waste of $71. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "save your money don't come here\n",
      "The place is always full. There's no other way to emphasize how popular Miss Korea is and how they attract everyone off the street with their menu variety. Casual Korean fare and lots of bar snacks combos bring lots of people looking for a quick bite, an easy hangout over soju, or a full comfort meal in the Yonge-Bloor area.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My usual party's go-to items are the fried chicken and the army stew (kimchi ham hotpot). We'll often grab a bottle of soju to accompany the meal, which polished off the experience. One of the unique things to note is that they do not serve any side dishes! This sounds horrible and sad for Korean fare, however I think this caters well to the type of food they offer and the setup they've got. It's really like going to a pub where everything is no-frills, as opposed to going to a casual restaurant. The seating are basically all stools except for a small number of tables to the side, the tables are all metallic circular tops they're geared towards easy cleaning, it all almost looks like a street vendor has moved into a shop. They boast a private room upstairs for larger groups, but I've yet to see anybody actually use it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The biggest pitfall of this place is the washroom - which costs them a whole star in my rating. Two broom closets have been converted, one for each gender, and they're up the stairs. I've been in lots of tiny washrooms but this takes the cake for being the tiniest and seemingly grungiest. If you can, go before you show up and don't go while you're here. Eat quickly as there's bound to be a wait for your table, don't bring too much luggage as there will be no space at all for it, and enjoy the food!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This really is my go-to comfort Korean food place in the area, but I'm always on the lookout for other nearby contenders that're more restaurant and less pub. For now, you'll find me here.\n",
      "The service was horrible overall.  They charge gratuity without telling you ahead of time.  It was extremely hard to find servers because they were just up near the counter laughing and talking themselves, ignoring customers.  The chicken we had ordered smelled old that it stung like some rotten food.  Food was bad and the service worse, I'd stay away.\n",
      "Being Korean, I am super picky with my korean   food. The bonchon was lackluster and mainly tasteless. The kimchi was horrible. The meats were ok, fresh yes...but the prices were insane for the amount of food you get. Do not drink the barley tea...yes, they messed up the tea.\n",
      "This place is solidly down the middle for me. Nothing really stood out as great, nothing was horrible. I dined here with fellow yelpers and it was a first for all of us. We ordered the dakgalbi, gamjatang and kamponggi. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The dakgalbi comes as table-cooking only if you do 2 or more orders of it so we did that. Surprisingly then, it came out as a table-cooking but the chicken was already cooked. They mix it up all the ingredients at the table for you on top of the burner though. I suppose she figured it was done and she shut off the burner but we were just starting our meal and so we turned it back on at low heat. No big deal, right? Guess they're saving fuel money or something because as soon as she noticed she came right over and shut if off without looking at us or saying a word. Strange, indeed. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The kamponggi was alright. I love when it's freshly fried and still has that crispiness on the outside although it's covered in sauce, which is totally just my preference and I know I can get it like that at a few places up the street. The kamponggi here was already soft on the outside. The chicken was nice and tender. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The kamjatang came bubbling hot which was great and with a bowl of rice. The meat fell off the bone nicely. The actual soup base could use some work.. with more spices to give it a thicker, fuller flavour. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I would probably not go here again.\n",
      "HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Went here a few nights ago, Friday night, with my family and service was horrible. Waitress didn't get our drink order, just gave us water, and when we did get our drinks, took forever to get a refill. She got my food order wrong and charged me for two for the same dish, instead of such substituting for the same price. No sorry, no manager to assist when I asked for one, just gave me a number for me to call.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Plain and simple, epic fail. Never coming back\n",
      "It saddens me to leave negative reviews at a place I once enjoyed going to. The service used to be on point, the food used to be delicious, but today, during my lunch with a few coworkers, my experience was horrible! Zoran was the waiter that ruined this experience for me. Gotten my order incorrect twice, refilled my Sprite with water (even after I specifically said I had sprite in my cup and not water) and screwed up our check for the entire party. I was so excited to see that Bonchon finally re-opened here in Vegas but with the crappy service that I received today; I refuse to return! There's so many enjoyable places to eat here in Vegas. Crab Corner/Archi's Thai is in the same plaza, so do yourself a favor and go there. You'll more than likely get better service and be more satisfied than here.\n",
      "This was our first time trying Bonchon. The chicken wings were good. The service on the other hand was horrendous. Our waitress, Lucy, was rude and had an attitude. The chicken didn't have much sauce so we asked for some extra on the side. She just said No. She didn't give an explanation, no apology, nothing. I asked why, she paused and said it was a corporate policy. \r\n",
      "I understand policies, but there is a way to handle things and explain things and she definitely didn't care to. After a while, she came back, took the chicken and returned with the wings having been tossed with some additional sauce. Again, no apology or explanation. \r\n",
      "My daughter was having the Udon Soup and I asked for a small bowl but was told they have no small bowls left! Seriously? Lol! I improvised and used the edamame bowl. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When we got the check, an 18% gratuity was included. No wonder she didn't care and provided horrible service!  Sad...\n",
      "I got the bibimbap and half and half 10 wings wing and drum sticks. LOVED the chicken, but the Bibimbap was so horrible! It was cold (I thought it was supposed to be hot?). It tasted like a mix between feet and raw fishy fish. I may get the chicken again, but I am not going to try anything else. Maybe it is just my taste buds that do not like Korean food, or maybe their Bibinbop is just horrible?  This I do not know. I have never had that before, so I have nothing to compare it with.\n",
      "This is the very first time I am writing a review and it's not even about the food. The food was great but the service was horrible. We ordered 5 items. We had to send back the bimbimbap twice due to server error. Our kimchi and rice was forgotten and had to wave down the lead server to get it corrected halfway thru our chicken. When we got the kimchi, it looked like a hot mess and when the server was told that this was not kimchi and that it was coleslaw, he proceeded to say it was kimchi. Finally, the lead server came over and corrected the error again. Our server then came back from the kitchen and  gave us the kimchi after blaming the kitchen for the error. When we got our check, we were over charged for the bimbimbap. Final straw, he gave us the corrected bill without a pen. Ok, I get it, it was his first day on the job, but dang he blamed everything on someone else and proceeded to have errors after errors throughout the course of our dinner. The best part was when the lead server commented to us that our server was lost. Awesome, right!?!?!? It's so sad when the food is great and the service does not live up to it and leaves a sour note to the experience. Would not recommend this place until they get their act together. Best of luck. Will stick to Soyo for now.\n",
      "Super Disappointing. I have been waiting to go here because they just recently opened back up and it's close to my work. A few of my coworkers and I went in and I got the boneless lunch special with rice. It was a way to Breaded and was definitely more breading then it was chicken. If you are going to go here I recommend getting the drums or the wings because at least it will taste like chicken. Fair warning the spicy is really really spicy and if you've never been there before and they forget to tell you you're going to be shocked. Also do not expect any customer service. I might've gone back to try the other chicken, But the customer service was so horrible I will never return. Had to ask for everything three or four times, they were stingy with everything from napkins to ranch and it's just not worth it.\n",
      "The food was blah, but the experience was horrible. The atmosphere was jaded with loud profanities from the bar from a group of 4. 3 guys & 1 girl each trying to out do each other bothering other tables with there surveys of the outfits they had on. It got louder and louder, even the bartender left to avoid that group. But when your kids have to hear those profanities, it's eat what you can. Take the rest to go and don't comeback again. It was frustrating.\n",
      "Lunch,  don't bother,  unless you want to overpay.  I eat a lot of Korean food.  Lunch beauty menu's spicy chicken was horrible.   First,  I didn't order Mexican food,  it was full jalape챰os.  Super Mexican hot.  Also, there was only 5 small pieces of chicken,  1/2 inch or less in diameter.  Nothing but onion and bell pepper, sauce. ..  ton of jalape챰o. ......\r\n",
      "Poncha is great. \r\n",
      "Service is great. \r\n",
      "Atmosphere is great. \r\n",
      "Very clean.\n",
      "Is this the best version of Korean chicken I ever had in Las Vegas.. nope, but it not a horrible product.    Perhaps, I'm spoiled and had a much better version of Korean fried chicken in Hawaii with Chicken Alice, and Kay Lunch center.   \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      " I was quite excited to check this place out, and made a special trip from Henderson to get a order in of their mild spicy chicken.     Since this joint is in the food court of the Greenland shopping complex, it only made sense to kill off a few minutes in the market and wait for my made to order dish.    \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ten minutes later,  my order was done, and I was quite surprised on the weight of a six piece order, but this where the entire process turns on me.      The chicken crust was very light, almost like a Chinese Manapua man truck version of fried chicken, but the meat was kind of dry.     The sauce was a little too sweet and  heavy, and they soaked the heck out of the bird.       It was a cross of Gokujang, garlic and honey, and I had a much better version of this type of Korean chicken at the Hawaiian BBQ at the Galleria Mall food court in Henderson.     \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sadly, out of six pieces, I still have four sitting in my refrigerator. and will pealing off the meal, and giving it to the dogs in the morning.....at least they will appreciate it. very much.\n",

      "Pros:\r\n",
      "Large amount of seating\r\n",
      "Every item on menu comes with a picture\r\n",

      "Average, average, average\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Opening the menu it's refreshing to see that the menu has pics for every single item they have.  Korean restaurants almost always just use phonetics in English.  It's always written Gamjatang and not spicy pork bone soup.  If you're not familiar with Korean food most of the time it's guess work for you to determine what you're actually ordering.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We ordered the beef ribs, gamjatang and chicken ramen for our little one.  Here's how they staked up:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Beef ribs:  I use the steamed beef ribs at Song Cooks as my baseline.  The ribs here were definitely not as tender.  Imagine trying to eat not so tender meat with just chopsticks, not easy at all.  It was a struggle throughout the meal.  The taste was OK, a caramelized onion type of taste.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Gamjatang:  The bones were half tender, could of been more if you ask me.  The broth was right in the middle between rich and thin.  It wasn't bad, but nothing special could be said as well.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Chicken Ramen:  This one was the most disappointing to me.  It was like eating instant noodles.  My GF thought it was a bit better, but not by much.  \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This place just didn't do anything for me.  The food wasn't bad, but like I said, it wasn't great either.  It's the only Korean place in the area so it's got that going for it.\n",
      "The service was great! You push the call button and one of the wait staff will be at your table very quickly. The restaurant and restrooms are very nice and well maintained. As far as the food goes, nothing was amazing, but nothing was horrible either. We did not try the BBQ, and might consider going back to try that sometime. We did try the Yuk-Gae-Jang and the Dragon Roll, Hawaiian Roll, Wildfire Roll, and California Tempura. We felt that everything was a little overpriced and we know better sushi spots with cheaper prices.\n",
      "The family took me here for my birthday. We won't be back. Easily the worst service I think I've ever had out dining. Food was mediocre at best. Really skimpy portions for the BBQ. The side dishes were all of poor quality. Food was better when it was a Friday's.... The atmosphere and the hovering owner and manager was just off. I felt bad because I think they know it's a rip off yet perhaps they aren't setting the prices..... also to our undertrained and horrible waitress, never ever ask if you need change.\n",
      "If you have never liked Korean food and think kimchee is horrible, this is the place to come to learn better. Yummy food, nice atmosphere, and terrific service. Korean barbeque at its best. One warning, the amount of food is astounding. Bring extra people or plan on taking some home. Hey, it's good enough that you'll want more the next day.\n",
      "First time here with family from out of town and the meals started to arrive way before our drinks. We were all dying of thirst and pressed our call button as we were sitting in one of the booths. Server came in and got our drink orders again. Still our drinks came 15 minutes later. We pressed our call button and they shut it off on their end. We pressed it again and then they came in with our drinks. This wasn't even the worst of it. My sister in law was feeding herself and her daughter. My sister in law felt something in her mouth after having a spoonful of rice. It was a pretty decent size metal in her rice. We definitely rang our call button to our server. He displayed his sincere apology and went to talk to the manager. Their compensation was to give us all free dessert on the house. After displaying her loss of appetite after the encounter and that it there would've been a possibility in her daughter eating that metal, they offered a different food type (dessert). We never got to actually speak to a manager which shows the professionalism of the restaurant. They offered us a 10 dollar gift card to use on a return trip. We started we were out of town and that we were not going to be back here. I managed to have them use it on our current transaction and they did. Overall, service for food wasn't bad but being that restaurant only had 6 tables filled, that was horrible service to get just drink orders. Management did nothing to help ease my sister in laws mind after that encounter with the metal in the food. 10 dollars doesn't suffice. We were definitely not asking for a free meal and not even 50 percent off of the meal. We were definitely disappointed in management not even speaking to us personally and helping to resolve the issue. Having a piece of metal in food should not be resolved with free dessert. We would've just been satisfied with 10-20% off at most or not paying for the rice dish we found the metal in. I definitely will not come by here if we ever come back into town.\n",
      "Went here at 3am on a Thursday night with 2 other friends.   They were cleaning while we were eating and had all the chairs up on the tables except for ours.  Not the best atmosphere to eat in.  Ordered our food and I ordered and received my soup with meat...the meat was horrible... pretty sure it was because it was 3am and they were just trying to get rid of what was left.  I've had the same dish many times here and it was never this bad. When I asked the server, he promptly said it was the cook.  And when I asked to speak to the cook...she promptly get upset and said that's all they had and it's the way it always is.  Incredibly poor service, bad attitude and did not care at all what climate customers eat in.  Will never go here again.\n",
      "I usually don't write it like that ever. I am sorry to say but as Korean from Korea, I wouldn't recommend this restaurant. \r\n",
      "foods were ok.(I mean if Canadians say it's ok, It means usually it's not ok). \r\n",
      "I understand It's not in Korea. but compare Other Korean restaurants in Toronto, The side dishes were horrible. also, one of the servers were too unfriendly. I understand Work is hard. so she didn't want to smile. at least she should have said something that if I ask or order. I didn't even know I ordered my foods. \r\n",
      "To be honest, I didn't want to pay at least 5% for a tip. but I paid, cause another server was very nice.    \r\n",
      "however, I won't go there anymore.\n",
      "Food is 5-star awesome. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Review is for one of the 3 waitering staff (the tall bigger guy working on Sat night Oct 14, 2017). This guy has an unfriendly grumpy attitude who thinks he owns the place! I have been to this place over 50 times over the last 4 yrs. This is the 4th time he's served our table with the same horrible attitude i.e. doesn't greet, takes your order in a condescending manner, responds to you in the harshest hap hazard fashion possible, etc.  \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Service with the previous 2 waitresses (they were there until May/ June of this year) was fantastic - they were friendly, greeted you as you entered, said good bye when you left and provided great service. Owners need to coach/ sort this particular waiter out else you'll be loosing me as a customer as well as plenty others I'm sure! He is damaging your restaurant's reputation as I've come to enjoy over the past 4 years.\n",
      "NEVER IN A MILLION YEARS COME HERE.  The food is Inedible and gross. The service is horrendous and the owner tried to fight my husband ( physically pushed him) when we argued that we wouldn't pay for the food ( we offered to pay for the the alcohol and the banchan) I can't believe the horrible experience we had and then the owner called the police when we said we wouldn't pay for the food. I have never in 33 years on this earth had such a bad experience. He called\r\n",
      "My husband an asshole in front of the whole restaurant. I'm in shock and can't believe it. Please never come here. Save your money and go to McDonald's if you're hungry.\n",
      "This place has a horrible sign that makes it kind of blend into the rest of the plaza, which I think is why it wasn't so busy on a Saturday night. The food here is fantastic though. The Jap Chae was sooooo good. One of the best I've had and I've tried a lot. It was definitely the best dish of the night. The kampungi was also good and not that spicy. The soon tofu was above average too and pretty spicy. The ban chan is decent and they gave us a refill when requested. The food comes out quickly but the waitresses seemed overwhelmed because there was only 2 of them for a half full restaurant. All in all this is probably one of the best Korean restaurants in Mississauga now.\n",
      "I came here the other night because I was craving tofu soup. Mr. Tofu is my absolute favorite, and I had been craving tofu soup for a long time! Alas, they close at 5 on Fridays. I did arrive there at 4:46, but they already closed. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Anyways, I decided to try this place instead since it was at the same plaza. Pricing is quite a bit more. For a regular tofu soup it was about $12. I got the pork flavor with a level 8/10. The soup had no flavor and there wasn't even a spicy flavor. I was extremely disappointed since the soup tasted horrible and didn't satisfy my craving. Plus it was pricier. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The ban chan was pretty tasty. They had kimchi, kimchi radish, fish cake, broccoli amongst other things. However I would have rather had better tasting soup. It is to be expected, I guess since it is a Korean BBQ restaurant. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The service was pretty great. The gentleman check on me a few times. Granted there was only one other person dining.\n",
      "Horrible! Horrible Korean BBQ experience ever, throw rice and water on the table, when place meet on the grill like feeding animals! No refill water, give us wrong order of meet three times! The service is horrible! DO NOT Come this place!\n",
      "From reading previous Yelp reviews, I definitely have to agree that aside from the food being good here, they have such horrible service. I was seated right away by the host and because my friend was on her way, we wanted to try and order ahead of time since she was on her 1 hour lunch break from work. Once I was seated, I waited for about ten min for a waitress to come by so I can quickly put our orders in. As I was looking around for someone, I noticed it was not busy at all with only three tables occupied on the other side of the restaurant. The host (who happened to be walking by me) saw that I needed someone. When he finally came to the table, I told him I was ready to order and if he can find out who the waitress is. He just stood there and asked what I wanted to order. It was sorta odd for him to take the order but I didn't care because no one even came to say hi. As for the food, I ordered from the lunch special menu: bulgogi bento box for me and spicy tofu soup with kimchee for my friend. Everything was delicious and we were surprised that the portions were huge for a lunch special. They were even decently priced too. We only saw our waitress a few times- once for the food, another time to give us two glasses of water, and lastly, to hand us the check. The entire time we were eating, she didn't even bother to refill our waters or even check in on us from time to time to see if we needed anything. We had to flag that same host just to ask for hot sauce since we could not find our waitress anywhere. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Overall, I only gave this place three stars for the food and the lunch special prices. Other than that, this place has poor customer service. I gave this place a try and I can definitely say I won't be coming back. There's much better Korean restaurants that have both excellent customer service & food.\n",
      "Mr. Tofu was closed for electrical issues and my family had already parked....so plan B we walked over here.  Everything was mediocre and disappointing with this restaurant.  This restaurant only has tables with the bbq grill in the center and parties of 7 are shoved into a little booth with a chair at the end.  They seriously need more table space if they are going to put out banchan and food items.  Due to the fact that the table was so crowded, a glass of water was knocked over.  The waiter...stood there and didn't offer assistance, no towel or additional napkins.  The box with the chopsticks was emtpy, we asked for chopsticks.  We had to ask a few times before chopsticks were brought over.  At one point we asked for additional napkins, and the waiter told us they were available on top of the counter and we could help ourselves!!!  Excuse me?! What did they hire you for? This last encounter with the waiter pretty much sums up the customer service at this place.  \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Onto the food, the banchan consists of kim chee, pickled cucumbers and radishes, bean sprounts, mashed potato, and broccoli.  Probably the lamest combo of banchan and the least tasty version I've ever seen.  I've had food court Korean with better banchan selection.  I was craving cold buckwheat noodles, since I was introduced to it at Soyo the week before.  However, this place obliterated my craving probably forever.  The noodles are thinner than the first version I had and clumpy.  The beef broth tasted like MSG water....it was altogether a horrible dish.  The galbi was overly sweet and didn't have a nice char on the outside.  The bimbimbap was just average.  The seafood pancake also was mushy and didn't have the crispy exterior that some places can achieve.  The sundubu is definitely not as good as Mr. Tofu....there's a reason why people pick this place as plan B.  Although Mr. Tofu has a much more limited menu, the prices for basic items like tofu soup, noodles, bimbimbap are probably $5 less over at Mr. Tofu.   For me this place will be plan Z...i.e I probably will never eat here again.\n",
      "Eh. This used to be my go to Korean food restaurant. I ordered a pick up order today, the pork tofu soup (soon du bu) and a order of Kalbi. I was so shocked first by the price! Haven't been here in a while but I am pretty sure that the prices definitely have gone up in the past year. Not appetizing. Secondly, my soup was not as delicious as I remembered. There was no flavor! Also felt like i got a smaller portion than usual. Completely disappointing and I don't think I'll be back. I have VERY high standards on Korean food and this was far from it. There are so many other places out there that I will now be looking for a new Korean restaurant. This used to be good, ain't horrible but I've had better.\n",
      "Ive had good experience from this place once. I came back with a friend and was very disappointed. There was hair on one of the side dishes. Service was horrible and the place wasn't even packed.\n",
      "IF I COULD I WOULD LEAVE 0 STARS! My friends and I went here for dinner and we will NEVER come back! The service was so bad and when we wanted to get our grill changed this one lady just sighed and when she was replacing it she coughed all over her hands which was so nasty! then everytime we wanted to order the people would give an attitude and sigh everytime and when they would drop it off at our table they would just throw it. then the worse part was when we were checking out and we left a smaller tip because of the horrible service and the lady wanted to tell her that we had to leave a high tip! like what the heck. and she was rude as hell when we told her no because of the bad service and she was hella running an attitude. SHE WAS LUCKY THAT I STILL LEFT A TIP! gratuity wasnt even included because we were only four. WORSE KOREAN BBQ PLACE EVER! if you guys want kbbq you can find one still cheap but still provide good service!\n",
      "Wayne the server was great but front door manager was horrible, charged me for onions and 3 jalepenos wasnt welcoming at all  didnt have rice paper potato salad was horrible overall garbage spot got to Gen kbbq a million times better and also no tai tea f this place\n",
      "After a long night of bar hopping in the vegas night clubs, some comfort food was a must. After waking up at the crack of dawn we Yelped online for a korean restaurant and found this place which had  a overall rating of 4 stars. ABSOLUTELY WRONG! You know when you're very hunrgy and anything you eat tastes great, in the case of this restaurant the food just RUINS your appetites. I ordered the mandu-ddukguk and my gf ordered the soft-tofu galbi combo. Now I'm not sure if it was because it was 7:30 am or maybe the chef wasn't there but my mandu-ddukguk was absolutely horrible. The soup base had a strange sour taste to it and  ruined my appetite. The soft-tofu tasted better then my soup but still wasn't up to par. The galbi that came out was of poor quality meat, the cut of the meat was fatty and had no real meat. Being Korean and living in downtown LA, great korean food is 5 mins away, I'm not usually a snob when it comes to korean food, but this was just horrible. Stay away!\n",
      "worst food, horrible service, bad experience! top it off, we cooked our meal ourselves because the waitress was upset.\n",

      "Arrived for lunch around 12:30 pm, ordered combo of wings and drumsticks in soy garlic sauce along with an order of Bulgogi.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Restaurant was pretty full for a Monday lunch time, took our order right away and then waited and waited for our food. If you are on lunch from work the wait for food will kill your hour lunch and then some. Took 45 minutes to get the chicken, Bulgogi was 55 minutes. Then waited for our bill, total time from sitting down to leaving - 1 hour 25 minutes, for 2 entrees!! I understand that this is a newly opened restaurant, but one of the workers  was working his tail off, while ours was just over whelmed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Good size variety of dishes and a big size menu.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The garlic soy chicken is very good, wings are good size, drumsticks are very big\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Bulgogi is bland and would not recommend, need some Bulgogi \r\n",
      "marination sauce on the meat. Says it is marinated in a homemade sauce, must of missed marination on this skillet. Even though it came on a metal skillet, I swear it seemed like it was boiled or steamed, probably the worst tasteless Bulgogi I have ever had! Seriously, did not want to eat anymore, made a doggie bag with the remaining rice, took it home and fed it to my dog.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Overall, I really liked the Korean Soy Garlic chicken, stay away from the Bulgogi and they were either under staffed or the help was horrible. Come on 1.5 hours to eat here is unacceptable.\n",
      "OMG, where to start.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I yelp on lots of Korean restaurants as I enjoy Korean food being Korean and remember food from back home. This place should not be considered Korean at all. It is a fusion place and catering to anyone but asian people. The first 3 pages on their menu is Chicken wings.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I walk in and and wait for 5 minutes to be seated. It was not busy as only 4 tables were occupied and there were 3 servers. Once seated, we waited another 5 minutes to get soda's and then another 5 because they forgot the waters.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I ordered Bibimbap and my GF ordered Kimchi Fried rice. My Bibimbap was horrible. A normal BiBimBap has an assortment of salads and cooked dishes  in a pleasant array around a scoop of rice. Nothing on this plate was palatable. The mushrooms were straight from the can. The server even agreed after tasting it. What is usually a saut챕d spinach salad was replaces by raw lettuce. The eggs had NO seasoning, no salt, no pepper, nothing Korean. Mcdonlad's does eggs better. The Bulgogi...if you can even say it was, was hard and dried out. The Bowl was predominantly rice with only a bit of veggies. Complete opposite of what it should be. To top it off, there was a teaspoon of quinoa on my rice. WTF is that?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The kimchi fried rice had soggy kimchi cabbage. It mushed with your tongue. Have better fried rice at Panda Express.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Neither of us ate our food and the waiter came to discuss. We showed him our food and he admitted the chef sometimes tries different things. We even had him try some of the food like the canned mushrooms. He deeply apologized and told us he would make things right on our bill since we ate none of it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The waiter took off $2.00 of a $40.00 bill as his way of making things right..... wow.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This place should be ashamed to have Korean food on there. Call it for what it is, which is a complete fusion (or confusion), but do not identify with Korean food.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It is sad, cause I love seeing Korean restaurants pop up, but this place disgraces Korean people, foodies, and those in the restaurant industry that pride themselves on good customer service. Their customer service makes the entire industry look bad. This places makes me wish we could give negative stars.\n",
      "The service is horrible in this restaurant. We waited here for 15 min and nobody came to serve us. We pressed the order button 3 times also. Servers passed by our tables without offering any help. We finally give up and leave.\n",
      "VISUAL AESTHETIC: 4.9/5\r\n",
      "The location is at a visible area and is very unique, with a red and white awning that sort of gives a street food feel. Inside there is an old nostalgic essence that depicts Korea and how street food cart areas would be set up. The colors are drab with heavy pops of beautiful saturated red. There's are golden pots hung along the roofing of one section which is quirky and very cute. Overall the decor is quite nice, old movie posters and school books to banners with word play on different signs. However, during busy hours, the abundance of smoke is sort of annoying. The fans do little to really take away the large clouds floating amongst the restaurant and the ceiling in the venue is actually quite high. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "FOOD: 4/5\r\n",
      "I find this sort of strange and this is all opinion but Hobak does not serve barley tea, a common staple amongst Korean restaurants. However, the iced water is fine.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The side dishes were fresh but alright in taste. The green onion salad lacks the namesake, green onion but I don't mind the bean sprouts so this did not bother me much. I make the steamed egg at home and add a kind of fermented shrimp in to add flavor and because Hobak did not have this, the taste was quite bland. It is common for Korean barbecue restaurants to remove salt within recipes due to the salt that is added with marinated meat and dipping sauces. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The salad had a sort of black sesame dressing which was delicious but the iceberg lettuce was sparse and I find that most KBBQ restaurants give romaine lettuce. I asked for lettuce wraps but Hobak does not provide this service. I had to ask for a bowl of rice, which is uncommon at most Asian restaurants in general because rice is typically served with a meal. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I ordered the Family Combo 1 which includes the ribeye, pork belly, pork ribs (marinated), and beef (marinated). The cheese and grilled mushroom and sweet potatoes were a nice addition. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The meat was of good quality, however lacking in variety. I have been to various KBBQ restaurants in Las Vegas and found multiple ones that have gems which include options I haven't seen here in America unless you were out in LA. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "SERVICE: 2/5\r\n",
      "From the reviews, I saw that this location supposedly provides great service. I did not experience that in the slightest. The service was moderate and the workers were slightly attentive but I was very uncomfortable at the unfriendly behavior. What shocked me though, was the actions of one of the workers, Myunghee. I was appalled at not only the way she reacted towards me but her fellow employees. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One young man (today was his second day) came over to take our order and he was friendly and prompt, but in all honesty, had no idea how to explain the menu. This is understandable though, due to the short amount of time he has been working at Hobak. Myunghee had stopped by our table shortly after to take our order and when I explained I had already given it to another employee, she stomped off without a word and proceeded to interrogate the young man who took my order, asking him why he took our order and what it was that I ordered. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I was sort of shocked but dismissed it as her being in a hurry to serve other customers. Shortly after however, it was no longer busy due to it being after lunch time. I was further astonished when I watched as she barked orders at employees and yelled at individuals, including the new worker. At one point, she began telling off an employee in Korean even though I had just spoke to her in Korean moments before the occurrence. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was rude, unprofessional, and embarrassing. Regardless if an employee has done something incorrectly, it is unacceptable to yell at them in front of a customer. Especially if a customer understands what you are saying. Regardless of this fact, people know how to read body language and it was very wrong to treat your colleague so unprofessionally in public. This is not only reflected poorly on Myunghee herself, but also on Hobak. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "OVERALL EXPERIENCE: 2.7/5\r\n",
      "This is not a restaurant I will be returning to. I felt as though the interior was adorable and that the decor really reminded me of Korean nostalgia, however I cannot find myself enjoying the lack of variety and professionalism at this restaurant. I really wanted to enjoy this location due to the wide acclaim and the response amongst my peers, but the horrible service was not worth it.\n",
      "Love them the best Korean BBQ ever... their customer service could improve but it's not horrible\n",
      "The meat is excellent quality. The people are nice and friendly but never bring any refills unless you ask. We had to ask for water 3 times. We had to ask for the free side refills as well. They were not good about removing empty containers either. The free sides are very pathetic. I have never been to a Korean restaurant with such a bad selection of free sides. The water refills sometimes comes in a steel container and sometimes in these horrible plastic things that look like someone's cheap used personal water bottle. The quality of the meat is most important, so I still give it 4 stars and it's rare to find  'nice' Korean food servers even if they aren't so good at the service part\n",
      "Wow okay I don't even know where or how to start this.. my friend and I were in Las Vegas during EDC weekend and it was packed with people! The wait was 1 hour long but after carefully reading reviews we decided it was worth the wait. It definitely was! Hands down the best service, food and atmosphere! As we were sitting there waiting.. I paid close attention to the staff, they had great communication skills - they worked so fast to get the tables cleaned and set for the next guest. Everyone was moving around and I could not even see one person slacking or on their phones. AMAZING! I absolutely was amazed and it simply got us to patiently wait for it table. Finally, or name was called and (I wish I could remember our servers name -horrible memory :( )  Our server sat us down and explained everything to us and also generously apologized for the wait! Whhhaat!? I just can't rave enough about this place! The food was just amazing and I can't urge everyone enough to make sure they make a stop there if they are in Vegas!! I promise you if there is line which there might be its worth the wait - you'll be happy you did!!!\n",
      "Great communication with all of the servers. Had great service throughout our dining and the food was delicious. We chose the beef selection and was able to had a great meal in what seemed like a 1960s sort of themed Korean bbq restaurant. The servers have sneeze guard masks which is very nice to have that assurance of cleanliness while they cook your food and also their communication with their walkie talkies allows for faster food service which was helpful in our meal experience. The restroom was kept fairly clean and also offered service toothbrushes and mouth wash to rid of the food odor after eating. The one complaint I had was when our pajeon was set up with the other side dishes at our table before we sat down was cold. I thought it was possibly served cold but when we asked for other rounds of side dishes it was then served hot. Also I highly recommend that you do not try their slushy machine for it isn't mixed right and tastes pretty horrible. Overall this was a great experience. The start and finish to our dining is what lost the star. 4/5 but will def come back when I visit Vegas again.\n",
      "I had been to this korean bbq many times already, but this is the first time I had felt the need to write a review. I had once believed Hobak was the best korean bbq in town, but tonight had proved me wrong. I was at table six, my server was horrible. My server was a short, latino, male. He had i believe three to four table, but had all his attention on the one four top. The table next to our's was also his, but both of our table had to cook and flip our own meat just to prevent it from being burnt. It is not that I feel the need to be lazy to not cook my own food, but my previous visits to this place was excellent serviced by an excellent set of staffs. Our server had to receive help from another server to serve his three to four tables. He would approach our table only to move the meat clamp from one side of the table to another, WHILE the grill was turned to max. I had to check with him for each and everything I had ordered. WOW!! And when our desert was served, it was simply placed on top of another dirty plate, because our table top was full of dirty dishes. When I was checking out I didn't even have enough space to sign the check. WORST DINNING EXPERIENCE I HAD AT HOBAK.\n",
      "Food was good.  The meats were tender and some of the best we've ever had.  However,  this place gets crowded.  Ventilation is horrible.  I wish they would turn the AC on higher.  It was so uncomfortable trying to eat in such a crowded, smoky, hot place.\n",
      "1 star for the hostess horrible decisions and communications. Didn't get to try the food yet. \r\n",
      "Got to there place at 8:25. We have a party of 9 (7 adults + 2 kids). Told by the host it would be a 30-40 minute wait. Tey even gave us a buzzer. While waiting we noticed there were lots of small tables and no big table so we told the hostess we are willing to sit at 2 separate tables. Went up to check at 9:35 to see that they sat 6 parties ahead of us, even though we told them we were willing to sit at 2 separate table! \r\n",
      "I'm sure the food is amazing with the 5 star reviews so with how much business you get why not invest in training your hostess with better costumer service. Train them on what to do with big parties. Before seating smaller parties ask the big party if they are willing to sit separately. It doesn't take a college degree to know that. Just common sense. Nothing is scarier than a hangry customer. My family are visiting from out of town and leave tomorrow. This was suppose to be a special dinner for the last night,  that's why we chose this place. So disappointed and upset to have our night ruined. 9 hangry customers. Don't wait until your customers are pissed off before you communicate with them. It's too late by then. Invest in a more accurate seating system and train your hostess to communicate! Seating 6 parties ahead of us is unacceptable and pure ignorance.\n",
      "This restaurant is about as Overrated rated as  the QB Jimmy Garropolo ... To start the meat cuts were too fatty... I ordered rib eye and it had more fat than any Pork Belly!!!! The meet had a horrible propane gas taste and the meal was waaay over priced for what you get!! The sides were not good at all. The service however was excellent and friendly... There are no knives to trim all the fat either... Save your money and hit Tbones or a solid Steak house!!!\n",
      "I really want to give this place a negative star. This place is horrible. Does not even have bibimbap!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! What kind of Korean restaurant doesn't serve bibimbap???!!! In conclusion this place is very very vegetarian-unfriendly.\n",
      "Not much was done right and no service recovery when it is mentioned.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Servers were nice, service was horrible. Small table, won't clear the dishes, small portions for a party of 3 even for large dinner combo. Party of 5 sitting on the table, we ask for more banchan, should double up on one plate. Slow... slow service for the meats and low fire. We hungry, get it rotating. Didn't even change our grill after our brisket to fire wire. Took more than 10 min to get our ice cream after we paid bill. We literally left without it because it isn't worth an additional wait after 30min for seats that we are keeping for the next group. Get your heads in the game, my gods. And top it all off, it was for my birthday. I didn't get anything. I didn't want the loud music and lights anyway.\n",
      "After tasting horrible foods from South Point hotel, my husband and I were in heaven at Hobak Korean BBQ. The services from everyone who cook the beef on our table were excellent.

      "For the item X, I told them to make it less spicy. However, look at the picture, do you really think they are less spicy? At least my tongue is telling me they are hella spicy. I complained to the server to exchange the item. However, they refused to do so. The reason is that's already the minimum spicy they can make it. And since we already ate some of it, they cannot accept a return. ARE YOU FREAKING KIDDING ME?!????!!!!? The whole plate is all red and it tastes spicy AF, you tell me you can't make it better? And if we don't taste it, how do we know it is too spicy? \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then the server asked if there is anything he could do to make the situation better. Oh well, you are not remaking it, or taking it back, how do you think you can make the situation better? Mix in water to dilute the spiciness or what? \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At the end, they offer us a discount on the item X. They left us no choice but to accept the discount and keep the item X that we don't eat. \r\n",

      "When the check come, oh well, $2.25 of the original $15 item X. we paid $12.75 + tax for an item that would end up going to the trash. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The story hasn't end yet. When we got home, 2 out of the 3 of us had a diarrhea. The only thing we had in common was eating the bibimbap and drinking the water here. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Would definitely not come back again. And I urge you to stay away for safety reason.\n",
      "I brought my friend with me today and it was his first time.\r\n",
      "Sunday at 6pm and the place was packed!\r\n",
      "We were quickly seated but they did not bring out foor for quite some time..\r\n",
      "Were slow on drink refills and slow bringing rice/all you can eat requests!\r\n",
      "Was not horrible tho.. the staff was very friendly and sometimes quick.\n",
      "The receptionist was horrible. This is the first time Ive seen a racist asian. Theres a long queue and she told me there will be a little wait then she decided to send me and my sister upstair without even asking if I want to wait or be seated upstair. There is no clear instruction where the upstair is. I have to go back and asks someone else. Then here we go. The upstairs is dark and dirty. The waiter approached us and directed us to a shared table. Its okay to share table but placing us in between 2 patron and when I asked how am I suppose to get in, the waiter said nothing and no one wants to stand up and let me in. We went downstairs and with our surprise the line is gone. Everyone else was seated inside downstairs. What a shame for an asian to be a racist in a foreign land.\n",
      "Interactive meals are truly the best! This was my first Korean Grill House experience and I truly enjoyed it. I love being able to share small plates and being in charge of cooking your own food truly keeps things interesting. We sampled their fish, squid, chicken, beef and pork -- mixing any of it with the rice that was given was delicious. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I was surprised at how much seating was offered inside. One walking by might not thing of it being a big restaurant, but it really did seat quite a few people.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Service was decent - kind of slow, but not horrible by any means. I wouldn't mind returning!\n",
      "Took so long to get water and didnt ask us to order for 20 minutes. Once we ordered they kept bringing us the wrong things and forgetting to bring rice when we ordered. The waiter knocked over my friends glass of water and by the end they included the tip on a table of 3. Never coming back horrible service\n",
      "Ordered the la beef ribs and pork bone soup combo. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Worse decision ever.   The pork bone soup tasted great. Probably one of the best ones up town.  The la Kabli was horrible. The plate of ribs that was brought over had grill marks on it like it was a quarter cooked. Pretty gross for table top cooking. It's like someone didn't want the order cooked it a little and put it back. Anyways we  decided to eat it anyways.   Worse idea ever.  Let's just say it wasn't a good night after.\n",
      "Service is horrible. Came with my two daughter and had to wait over 20mins to get a table when clearly there were tables ready for us to sit down. No apologies or nothing. I was holding a car seat and the two managers or whatever was standing in the back holding hands and kissing while I was waiting when the table was already set up. Doesn't even deserve 1 star\n",
      "I really wanted to like this place. I really did. But there were too many things that went wrong. For one, it's a bad value. Portions are so small. Meat didn't look or taste fresh. Side dishes looked as if they have been sitting unrefridgerated for hours. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I can overlook that if management wasn't such an asshole, though. Seems as if management only cared for large parties, AKA more tip money. My friend and I were largely ignored by everyone for the first 30 minutes, coming in 15 minutes before a larger walk-in family. Management threw on that fake smile while approaching them, and gave them food before us... while looking at us sometimes and just brushing us off. And at that time, the restaurant wasn't even busy. We were one of like six parties. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Anyways, after sitting and waiting hungry, the BUS BOY (or some back kitchen worker) approached us and took our orders. Funny how someone underpaid cares more about customers than overpaid management. Our assigned waitress finally came like 10 minutes after the busboy and took care of us. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "If it weren't for the kind low level worker, I would give this horrible place zero or less stars, and if Yelp allowed it. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "If you have a small party, and look young AKA having less money than a family, count on getting blatantly ignored by management. If not, enjoy the fact that the owner is trying to capitalize on the fact that Korean food is exotic and rising in popularity by giving the cheapest cuts of meat possible. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Also, I hope the shitty manager didn't take the personal tip that gave to the only guy who gave a fuck about us.\n",
      "Not bad but not good. \r\n",
      "To be honest the only thing i liked about this place was the fact that its a small business. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We went as a party of 4 adults and 3 kids.\r\n",
      "Their tables were only 4 people seating so we had to sit separately... not a great arrangement for families bigger than 4! \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Also, they dont bring you more than 2 serving of meat at a time, even with a big party. They said its so you dont over order... really? \r\n",
      "2 hr limit and only 2 servings at a time for 7 people... \r\n",
      "Dont you charge for left over meat anyway?? \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Also the meat... everything that is marinated is poorly executed since i can still taste and smell the blood.(korean bbq usually requires the meat to be washed and soaked in water for a period of time to get the blood out, so the marinate gets embedded) \r\n",
      " \r\n",
      "To top off the horrible experience they have the nerves to add 18% gratuity. Really? Dont get me wrong, ive worked in the restaurant business. I believe in giving 18%+ tip anywhere I go. But with the lack of service and ridiculous rules for ayce?! \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We will not be returning for sure!\n",
      "Disappointing.  For the price you pay, go to GEN instead.  Not many options for all you can eat.  Meat quality was bad and tasted horrible, the kim chi and sides tasted horrible, soups were tasteless so we didn't even bother.  We came for dinner and was the only family there, no wonder.\n",
      "We've been here before in the past when the service and food was great.  It seems like it has gone downhill.  Our experience was horrible.  Our waitress was new so we tried to be understanding but it was difficult when everything that could go wrong, did.  Not all of it was her fault though as the kitchen was extremely slow as well and everything was very unorganized.  Our first round of meats took forever so the grill was just sitting there burning and smelling of gas as we wait impatiently.  We asked for chopsticks and dipping sauces that didn't come until later.  She also brought only one sauce like we were supposed to share so we had to ask for another.  That never came so we asked again.  We needed refills of several things but didn't even bother.  Since everything took so long, we decided to put in another order ahead of time.  We were wondering why it never came until she came over and asked if we were ready for round 2 and we told her we already placed an order.  She said she can't put the order in until we were done but that it would come out quick.  She also did not let us order more than 2 at a time.  15 minute goes by as we sat and watched our grill burning black.  We've eaten at a lot of AYCE's and never heard of such thing.  Why would you let the grill sit there burning empty?  At this point we we lost our appetite and just wanted to be done.  As soon as the meats arrived, we asked for the check.  It took another 20 minutes.  As for the meats...not very good quality.  We will not be coming back.\n",
      "I LOVE soon tofu so I just had to try this place close to work.  It's small with less than 7 tables.  Don't come for the decor come for the tofu!!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We ordered seafood soon tofu, toasted dumplings and the bulgogi bento box.  Got a free side of their fresh tofu.  The sides included a generous mound of bean sprouts, a grilled fish and radish kimchi. The dumplings looked like they were made on site.  Light and crispy skin with a meat filling and a garlicky dip.  The soon tofu came super hot and sizzling bubbly goodness and the accompanying rice with crispy rice crust soup yum!!  The fried tofu that came  with the bulgogi and as a side dish is to die for!  Light crispy batter surrounding a soft pillow of creamy tofu  that melts in your mouth.... Bulgogi was a huge portion of beef and a horrible side of cooked salmon sushi.  Stick to the tofu!!\n",
      "Horrible horrible horrible service!!  First of all, I did went there a few times as she was nice at first time but every time it just get worse. I thought perhaps she has trouble understanding English and I felt bad she did not have a help in the restaurant. I remember one time I asked for a mild tofu soup but it turned out to be super spicy and when I wanted to double check with her for what I ordered. She refused to talk to me and kept saying it's mild. Another time we ordered 2 bento box and she serve us with 2 side dishes when all the other table have more than 4. We asked for kimchi but she did not even response and walk away. She treats every table differently. I saw her smiling with other people and checking on them see if they are ok. I realize she only pretend to speak a few words in English when she is moody or doesn't want to respond to you. I can't believe how can such a bad place gets so many good reviews.\n",
      "It's a decent Korean BBQ. My wife and I ordered the beef combo. All the different cuts of beef were tender but lack the nice rich beef flavor. Bachan were okay nothing really fantastic. Food were just oaky for me but the service was excellent. The servers did all the cooking and they worked well together as a team. And I like the ambience, it was clean and contemporary. \r\n",
      "Pretty sure I will not go back, not because the food was horrible but because there's nothing compelling for me to go back. The other high-end Korean BBQ competitors just have better food.\n",
      "There are pros and cons to this place. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Pros: \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Yummy food and cuts of meat\r\n",
      "Very reasonable pricing\r\n",
      "Good variety of dishes\r\n",
      "You can make reservations\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Cons:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It's like a club. WAY too loud and you have to yell at your dinner mates.\r\n",
      "They need better ventilation. Smoke is CONSTANTLY in your face. It's horrible and you smell awful when you leave for hours. \r\n",
      "Meh customer service. The person who cooked for us did not tell us what the meats were. We had to ask every time. She seemed very busy and frantic. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Overall, this place was good. I should say--You get what you pay for.\n",
      "Awesome authentic Korean food with attentive seLunch special: Tofu Soup & Chicken $14.95 \r\n",
      "The chicken hot plate was kinda bland but nothing some kim chi won't fix! I loved the hot Heotkkae berry tea. Been told it's an herbal tea great for hangovers and digestive issues.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "12/6- Came for dinner. The young wait staff was horrible. I was the only customer and I received zero service and one of the young men made a smart ass remark when I left. There a zillion different Korean and/or Asian restaurants in Korean/Chinatown that I don't have to tolerate lil punk turds and nonexistent service.\n",
      "So this place had really horrible Service and their waitresses cook you rare me to eat and finally a lot of the food had no good flavor to it\n",
      "This is the third time I've been here, the previous two experiences are awesome. But this time is horrible, our server, a Korean guy, and another female Korean lady had really bad attitude since we walked into the restaurant, threw all the plates, bowls and even hot soups on our table, in front of our parents. When we asked for four bowls to share our back rib soup, the server even pretended he did not hear and left. It is the first time in the US I felt so disrespectful and disappointed about dining service. But all other servers and the manager are nice. I talked to the manager and he switched another server to our table. However, I will never come back. \r\n",
      "In the end, to your boss:\r\n",
      "You are not only doing business with Korean customers, you are serving customers from everywhere. These two servers merely hurt our feelings, but keeping them in your restaurant will harm your businesses. Please pay attention to train your employees.\n",
      "Worst place ever! Service is horrible! I am writing this review as I wait for someone to take my order... So far I've been waiting for almost 15 mins and counting. Trust me I will be asking to speak with a manager. Don't come here unless you have tons of time to waste!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "** after speaking to the manager, the server was much more attentive. When I payed the bill the hostess was very unapologetic , and actually pretty rude. I would of thought the manager would of offered some kind of compensation after our inconvenience, but I had to pay the whole bill of $147.51 (which included 18% gratuity for their bad service), probably not going to come back anytime soon **\n",
      "So I've been here several times with family or friends. Food has always been good.. This review is just for the service itself. Service is always a hit or miss but never this bad. But on this experience it was down right horrible. Our server took our order once and that's when we sat down. Our grill was burning black for about 10-15mins after asking 2 times from 2 different people for a grill change. Then finally the 3rd person I asked came back immediately to change our grill. Our actual server never once checked up on us, anytime we needed something we had to waive him down or ask someone else. We had to keep asking for the same thing cause they kept forgetting. So definitely not a great experience, will be considering to just drive to China town for better KBBQ experience despite the distance.\n",
      "If I could give less then 1 star I would they have horrible customer service no one knows if they are coming or going and we had a party of 11 along with another party of 11 and they got seated first! It was my sons 16th Birthday and they made it a horrible experience also 3 people in our party are allergic to seafood and yet they made NO accommodations!! If you want to have a nice family dinner and you have a big family DONT COME HERE!!! Also not to mention the party of 11 that came before us and were seated before is we're ASIAN!!! We are Italian go figure!! Oh yeah and go somewhere else!!!\n",
      "It's fine, but probably my least favorite Korean BBQ restaurant in Vegas. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The sides also seem to have been sitting out for a long time.  It feels very corporate and standardized, which I don't typically want in a restaurant.  Show me something unique!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The service is spotty. Sometimes it's great.  Other times it's horrible.\n",
      "Been here twice now great food best Korean bbq in Vegas in my humble option service was great the first time second time it was horrible I will still go back again and again!\n",
      "ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Its already hot outside. I expect atleast to be able to eat comfortably not swimming in sweat! My son has asthma and could barely breathe! Its a shame me and my family are regulars and love the food here. My sons favorite dish is the kfc. We have been out all day and didn't eat to save our appetite for dinner so we decided to stay and still eat because they actually had the chicken today.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thats one more thing too. You never know when they wonmt have something on the menu. Last week they had none of the fried chickens! ALL OF THE CHICKEN WAS UNAVAILABLE. And this is an ALL YOU CAN EAT?!? And the squid bulgogi is NEVER available. Why don't they just take it off the menu if you don't even serve it anymore?? \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now every single time we come, we are either greeted by the hostess or not. You have to really try to figure out what day is a good day when these people aren't in a mood. Almost every single time we come, they are never smiling. And talk to you as if its such a bother to them to have to take you to a table and explain the rules. Its as if they really hate their jobs and take it out on us customers. What kind of hostesses are these?!? The lady that had a red shirt took us to our table today. With a very annoyed and condescending tone, asked us if we've been here before we said yes and she continued to tell us the rules with the same tone. Not once did she smile and had the expression on her face as if we had done something horrible. I've worked in the food industry and understand when a customer is being really unreasonable and rude. And since I understand that, me and my family ARE never rude yet we still get treated like this with the VERY FIRST person that is supposed to take care of us. We always just let it go because the service after that is usually okay and the food comes out really quick. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But tonight was the absolute worst! Appetizers were super slow, drinks didn't come until 20 minutes later, not even getting refilled until conpletely gone, grill kept turning off and our server did the best he could to fix it but was still cooking very slowly, we were getting meats that we didn't even order and find out the server made a mistake and it was for the other table, and most especially it was HOT. I suggest no one comes here during the summer since their ac is broken!\n",
      "walked in at 11pm\r\n",
      "there was at least 7 or 8 people working \r\n",
      "didnt even greet us or  at least say hi for 5mins\r\n",
      "horrible...gg\n",
      "This is my second time trying this place out... Being Korean finding good Korean bbq is hard... To be honest the food is good here but the service is fu@$ing horrible. If you work at a Korean restaurant learn the names in Korean and in English.... Today it took them 13mins to get a sprite and so I got so irritated that I asked 3 times and still nothing so I went to the front and said I don't know how far you guys placed your soda fountain it shouldn't take you this long and as the waiter saw me go complain he sped walked over and gave me the Sprite... They never came and checked up on us so whenever we saw them walk pass us we had to quickly order... PS FOR ANYONE WHO NEVER BEEN IF YOU SEE THE SIDE DISH OUT BEFORE YOU SOT ASK FOR A NEW ONE. The table next to us had their side dish out 20m or so before some one sat down. That's disgusting. I will never come back to this place it's a joke\n",
      "If I can give this establishment a negative star, this place would win it in a heart beat.  I consider myself a Korean BBQ Courvoisier and this place blows in every way. \r\n",
      "We arrived around five and was greeted by the hostess rolling her eyes at us. We weren't the only lucky ones that got those rolled eyes too, customers that came after us all got the same. We got sat down after five minutes which was pretty good after what just happened.  \r\n",
      "First our server didn't want to be there and as far as we could tell the other waitress's near by had the same horrible attitude. They weren't happy and nobody smiled. But here you have an energetic family smiling and being positive until they bring out the food; it was a disappointment. The portions were like for my eight year old, we had to order like the max order over and over just to make something happen.  This place is the reverse of all you can eat (AYCE).  We weren't the only ones complaining about the servings. Then to top things up, we had to remind our waitress for our drinks, refills and napkins.  Then don't let me get started with the busser's; they were just running laps, passing tables with empty plates on them, I had to literally put the plates in front of his way for him to stop.  But they were all like this, this place is far from good.  I can't read anymore of these reviews from this place from people that don't know what real Korean BBQ AYCE is and the service. \r\n",
      "To end this horrible dining experience we were asked by our dopey depressed waitress if we were paying cash or credit? She waited until I gave her a response; to eventually have a rude cashier come up to us with a tablet asking me for my CC. I had to double check she actually worked there because she didn't introduced herself or let us know she was going to take care of our bill at our table.  Swipe, signed and was given a receipt then she walked away without saying thank you or anything like she enjoyed her job. \r\n",
      "So food was horrible\r\n",
      "Service was horrible\r\n",
      "Environment was crappy \r\n",
      "Will never comeback again!\n",
      "I walk in, and the place is PACKED. I'm like daaamn business is booming lol the wait was about 10 mins. The lady was about to seat us totally totally in the corner next to a seat two other people were next to and I felt it'd be awkward since the whole row was literally empty and sitting next to these people in the corner would be a really awkward dinner hearing both groups conversations so I asked the lady to be seated somewhere on the empty row and she seats us on the other end next to where they put all the dirty grills since supposedly a 6 person party was supposed to sit next to us (but they never even showed up until closing!) anyways. Our server was Eugene and he had probably the best customer service than anywhere I've ever been! He constantly made sure we had napkins, sesame oil, orders in, grills changed, and etc. basically his customer service totally made up for the host trying to put us in the horrible corner. Now The food, the meat all tastes like way better quality than honey pig, or even some of the korean BBQ on the southwest side of Vegas. I didn't get really bad indigestion from eating here versus any other korean restaurant. The only thing that's possibly different is their sesame oil, it doesn't taste that great with my pork belly versus other places, and their spicy tofu soup lacks a bit of authenticity but other than that; they also have Cajun shrimps you can grill and a huge variety of meat selections I mean so it makes up for it. I'd give this place a solid 4 stars but our server Eugene was so awesome I have to give 5 stars. I'd def recommend or probably bring all my friends here if we have time to drive across town\n",
      "I've been here one other time, and it was a good experience. Wanted to take my\r\n",
      "Mum to a nice restaurant and decided to take her there. Bad idea. First off, we got plastic spoons when I asked for cutlery. Was told some story about guests stealing cutlery so they had run out. Then service was horrible! Started off ok, but went downhill. Waited over 20 mins for a bowl of rice. Asked for things that never got to out table. All the while, saw the waiter serving and chatting with other people. Ended up asking a runner to bring us rice. By this time, all the food was burnt or cold. We had lost our appetite. End of the meal, asked for the check, twice. Took an extra 5+ minutes to get that. The food was still good, hence the two stars. Service was just so bad.\n",
      "I enjoy the food but this experience was horrible. It was my second time here. The first time being the soft opening so I excused the service a little bit. After being seated, we ordered the dishes and the food came out pretty fast. We soon ran out of side dishes and the dipping sauce. Our server was no where to be found. After about 10 minutes of looking around, someone came to change our grill and I asked for assistance. The person said he would inform our server. After about another 5 minutes, a different server helped, but he came back with half of what I asked for. By then I'm over this experience. I didn't even wait for the check. We went to the front and paid. I complained about the service to the front and the girl shrugged it off and asked if we wanted to speak to the manager and I asked what would be done and she said she didn't know with a giggle. I wish I didn't tip, but being from the service industry, I couldn't get myself to do that. I am highly disappointed. I only saw my server one time throughout the whole meal. I didn't enjoy dinner because I didn't have what I wanted to compliment my dishes. Plus, we didn't even get everything we ordered. Horrible. This is my first review ever. I was so upset, I had to share.\n",
      "Service was horrible I waited for 40 minutes after being seated for my server to to ask us what meat we wanted\n",
      "This is my second time here hoping they got their act together. I've been to the one in SoCal, the food and service were amazing. The food at the Henderson store is good but management is beyond horrible. They all look like chickens without a head running around with no purpose. There are empty tables but we still had to wait for 30 minutes, why?  They have no common sense with how to seat people. There were so many people that were mad and left. Get your act together, you've been open long enough. Food is good but this will not last in vegas if they don't change. Kristina our server was fabulous.\n",
      "I had high expectations due to the fact that I enjoyed my experience at the one in LA. First of all we had to wait, we've waited for almost an hour to get a table, which my friends and I didn't mind because we knew that they just opened a couple weeks ago. However, when we were sat down we asked our horrible server Sam for water and if they had hot tea. The response he gave us, I've never heard in my life. He said that they didn't have hot tea because it was too hot outside. Now, is that how you inform customers that you don't have hot tea?! You refer to the weather?!?! & so I asked another waiter and she mention they weren't serving hot tea at the moment which sounds more professional then what the other waiter said. Anyways, the meat wasn't that great. Not the same quality as the one in LA. The servers were slow and they didn't even oil our pan until we asked them to. It was just disorganized. When it was time for us to pay the bill, 4 servers came to ask if we wanted our check and we mentioned that someone was already getting it for us. We didn't get our check after another 20 min and when it came they made a mistake on our bill and so we had to wait for another 10-15 min. I was so upset I wanted to speak with the manager. Instead of the manager coming over they sent the assistant manager while the actual manager sat back and just watched. Seriously, is that how you run a business?!?! My friends and I were soo disappointed. This was my favorite KBBQ until that day we went to this location. Never again. It was sooo horrible!\n",
      "My boyfriend and I used to love coming to Gen when they first opened. However after removing several of our favorites off of the menu we stopped going. Tonight we decided to give Gen another try and it's gotten so much worse. The quality of the meat is horrible. Not only was it awful but we found ourselves spitting out bones while eating pork belly. This will be our last visit to Gen and I definitely do not recommend this place. If you're looking for a good KBBQ spot you should check out HWARO!\n",
      "Two stars only because this place was good in terms of service from previous experiences. This place feels like its going downhill. Food orders took a while to come out. We had to keep asking for status of certain items ordered. No drink refills, not even an offer to refill. While still waiting on food orders to come out, the server asks if we were ready to pay. Once the bill came, we were incorrectly charged but the hostess promptly fixed it. We still tipped. Hopefully the server, didn't expect good tip after giving horrible food service.\n",
      "My wife and I decided to try this place after she had a horrible experience in it about a year and a half ago. Long story short, some manager was very rude to her and her coworkers and kept trying to rush them out even though there was barely anyone else there for lunch. Fortunately we didn't see that same manager. This time around, the staff were very welcoming and polite. Our waiter was a little slow even when it came to getting our check. The quality of the meats are average or even below average. The briskets, the staple of kbbq, don't taste that good without the brisket sauce. Three stars since they have good appetizers and KFC (Korean Fried Chicken).\n",
      "The main reason why I am giving this place 4 stars is because of the awesome service. They have not disappointed me. Although I think Tofu Hut is so much better (but thats just my opinion). They have good brisket, but how can you go wrong with brisket? Its not seasoned anyway lol. The main thing I dont like about this place is the dipping they give. Its some type of sea salt with green tea leaves or something Idk but I didn't like it so I asked if they had salt and pepper with sesame oil and they did but again it was sea salt which can be too salty. The meat options are over whelming and their kalbi was not that greatly marinated. the steak was horrible. very dry and unseasoned. The pork belly was good, but again like the brisket, you cant really go wrong with it, its not seasoned. I did like how they often changed the grill out for you when it became dirty. Another reason why I rate this place 4 stars is because of the shrimp that they offer on the menu and the squid legs I believe they have as well. My boy friend orders those two things endlessly. Although I don't eat either of them, he loves them so thats a plus. I've noticed that they have ice cream macaroons which I'd like to give a try but of course you are charges separately for those.\n",
      "Would not recommended. First we called to see if there was a wait time the lady said not wait time as of now and we said can we put our name on the list we're only 10 mins away she's said no. When we get there and there's a 1 hr wait?! There's tables that are empty I don't understand or they didn't tell us why we couldn't sit there. Then they had the audacity to seat other people before us and made us wait an hour and a half. And when they finally sat us no apology was made for the time we had to wait. Then our waiter did not care to give us attention and it was our first time at a Korean BBQ and he didn't even tell us how things worked and spoke really fast. They're customer service was horrible. Will not be coming back. The food wasn't that good either no flavor.\n",
      "Been here twice to eat, for the sole reason that it's close to home.\r\n",
      "Definitely not a fan because of the horrible service.\r\n",
      "Wait times are ridiculous and the staff seems to be all over the place.\r\n",
      "Nobody knows their roles or what to do in general.\r\n",
      "Food is eh.. You get what you pay for with the price. Quality is just not there for me and some of the meats have a weird, pungent smell to them -- noticeable in the porks. They also don't serve steamed egg, no big deal but what a turn off. 짱\\\\_(�깂)_/짱\r\n",
      "I rather make the 30-40 minute drive all the way to Chinatown and be satisfied with a legit KBBQ restaurant, not a wanna-be.\n",
      "Gen Korean BBQ in California has always been our favorite go to, so my friends and I figured this place in Vegas would be the same. Boy, were we wrong! The meat quality was nothing special, and in fact, you can taste how low it is. The service was horrible. In fact, we never knew who our was the whole time. I understand the idea of everyone serving you for a faster service, but it was not executed very well. Instead, they seemed confused and often there were tons of miscommunication or missed orders. Konrad also did not seem very happy to serve us. We probably won't be back any time soon, and I do not recommend this place at all.\n",
      "Horrible fatty meat , Horrible service , even the female manager was horrible. Will not be returning!\n",

      "\r\n",
      "We were finally called and sat down.  The first part of there service seemed slow, we asked for water and a few things to start but it was our first time so we need some time for the rest.  By the time we ordered our next round our first round had not come yet...  All in all I think is was just a really busy night and the lull slowed them down a bit, pretty understanding of that.  When it did come it is small portions so it is good for the AYCE setting but please don't under estimate or they will charger you for not eating.  We paced ourselves, one if the things I really liked is the variety of meat they had.  I am a Bulgogi so give me that with one other thing and I am happy.  Here I tried so many things it made the experience fun for me again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The different kinds of meat I tried was great, the service was great, some of the appetizers were good.  A few downfalls in my mind is they seved the lettuce chopped on the side (like a salad) I like to warp my BBQ in lettuce with all the toppings.  They were also missing the soybean sauce one of my favs but because they serve the lettuce chopped it wouldn't matter anyways.  They do have a Radish wrap our friend loves my man liked it I am not a fan but that is only because I don't like radish, so that has nothing to do with the restaurant.  The other wrap he loved was a rice paper wrap.  I tried it was amazingly difficult to work with and all my food fell out anyways (horrible), not a fan but whatever that is a personal choice.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I am still giving 4 starts because all the things I disliked besides the lettuce wrap and the soybean sauce was a personal choice.  The restaurant is Really good the meant is great and some of the specialty meat is absolutely amazing!  I like the small serving sizes because it is an AYCE they portion it on the small side so you can eat more kinds!  \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "All in all, Great service, Good timing, could be a bit better expelling the menu if new even if our friend has been, food delivered quickly after the first lull, flavor of the meat and cuts of meat very good!  Could add non chopped lettuce, could add soybean sauce. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Pretty good stuff I might be back if on this side of town again!  If I lived on this side, well 100%\n",
      "Jessica and Shea where as fabulous as the food. Service was on point food some came cooked some you cooked yourself. Perfect balance. Will definitely be back. Only thing I'd change is the music, get some good Island beats going. The music playing was horrible.\n",
      "This place was amazing! First time here and we have been to another Korean BBQ and had horrible service. The service was amazing and was on point. They left us alone but it was like they had a sixth sense when we needed something. Our server was Luke and he did a fantastic job! Shout out to him for making us want to come back again! Would recommend the signature steak, roast beef, brisket, and marinated steak. Didn't care for the shrimp but someone might. Would recommend this place to anyone and everyone! Thanks for everything we could not stop talking about how amazing our experience was after we left. C:\n",
      "Although, they have the best japchae I ever tasted, this place doesn't deserve all the praises what so ever. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "First things first.... The service is horrible! All the staff were young and have no idea what they're doing! All they're good at is walking around. Walking like they're all models for us to watch. They did not tend to any of our needs, it took multiple waves for us to be noticed. Honestly, we only saw one person who was actually doing work and that's the guy who delivered the meat. The restaurant looked pretty overstaffed, maybe they need to focus on hiring people with experience first then I'll go ahead and give it one more shot.\n",
      "I have given this place a chance multiple times, and have always been disappointed. The flavors just aren't authentic enough. Also I don't know why but I keep tasting a weird aftertaste every time I eat here. It tastes bitter and leaves my mouth feeling dirty or gritty. The last time I was here I had horrible food poisoning. I will probably never try out this place again.\n",
      "Food was ok. Unfortunately, the female bathroom was broken on the day we went there. Somebody had a bowel moment and the toilet was not flushed. Lots of flies! Yes , they flew around in the restaurant and of course  infected the food. The bathroom is right behind the cashier counter. I felt horrible from what I saw and wished we didn't eat there. We will never go back to this place again though the food was ok.\n",
      "As you walk in, you can tell that there was no money spent on design or decorations. So if you are looking for romantic ambience, this is more like a local BBQ dive. Oh, there's a karaoke room in case you are wondering who is singing horrible imitation of K-pop.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Taste is very good for the three dishes we ordered, and I'm sure other dishes may have equally authentic flavors. But portion size is rather skimpy as compared to other Korean joints. Bonchons are also slim with only half a dozen plates. They are kind of cheap on rice and soup that come with the entrees. Rice bowl was half filled and soup was barely filled half way. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Service was fine but I dont like walking away hungry.\n",
      "This place give me the worst experience in recent ten years. The service is horrible. The waitress is very rude and I feel very disrespected. We wait for 20 minutes to order the food and 20 mins for check out. I ask to refill a small plate of kimchi and she looked at me with contempt. Then the worst thing happened is the lady gave me the check and she wrote the 15% tips for me. This never happened in my life. And I asked her. She told me that's the rule. For 3-5 people, tips is 15% 6-8 people 20% more than 10 people 25%. Since we have three people so she wrote the 15% tips for us. For 15% tips I think it is regular tips, but I feel very offended someone forced you to do so. I used to like this restaurant. And now I won't go anymore and I will encourage all of my friends not going. How can you treat your customers like this?\n",
      "The lady was pretty rude and definitely felt rushed. The service was horrible and for that reason I didn't actually end up eating there. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They make you order 2 meats if you want to eat there which I find nonsense. Wanted Glabi but couldn't it unless I ordered another meat.\n",
      "This was some of the worst quality food I've ever eaten.we had a beef combination meal.omg 100% fat .the server never explained what goes with what just brought all the side dishes and no explanation.really this was  horrible plus it was almost $100 for the meal for two with one beer each.I thought I might be sick\n",

      "It was my first time here with my sister, she lived in the area and I decided this is what I was craving.. I have always eaten Korean food growing up so I know what I like.. It wasn't busy when we walked in, maybe 3 tables..  It took them 5 minutes for them to even notice us, even seat us and give us water another 15 minutes. At this point I'm really annoyed but I decided to give them another chance to redeem themselves. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We sit down and order salmon sashimi, japchae and Hwe Dup Bap.. They give us our banchan which was mashed potatoes, kimchi and fried anchovy with peanuts.. It was a nightmare to get any servers attention to get more water.. So when we did get water she dropped down the glass of water hard, spilling it all over the table, walked away didn't care, didn't bother to apologize or come clean it up.. \r\n",

      "Honest to god in all the years have I eaten out or spend time in a restaurant (I've been a chef in the culinary business for 15 years, so I know how all parts of the house works with restaurant, I wasn't born yesterday).. I have never been so offended ever in my life..  NO matter how good food is or how EXPENSIVE it is (money is never a issue when it comes to good food), but if the SERVICE is horrible I will NEVER EVER step foot back in that restaurant and I will tell everyone I know about my experiences..\r\n",

      "I came here with two friends on a Friday night. Usually Korean restaurants are super polite and would provide us with tea and water right away.  However, this place did not give us the or water for the next half an hour even though we asked serveraly times.  The waiter had horrible attitude.  The food was very average.  I would recommend song Cooks or even galleria if I had to.  (24h).\n",

      "\r\n",
      "I can't complain...it's a great place for 24-hour food when your out late late at night and is craving for more of a hearty meal rather than a burger and fries situation. I have been here couple times I was never like amazingly impressed or have any horrible experiences. It is a good Korean spot for big parties craving for various Korean dishes from Kbbq to staple korean bibimbap.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Last time I went I got the pork and marinated lettuce dish which I absolutely wanted to try ever since I saw it on Korean dramas. The tender pork and the sweet and sour of the lettuce was great and very refreshing. You were supposed to wrap various spices between it. It is not your usuall bbq pork but the kind which has been marinated before hand and then wrapped between and vinegary lettuce for a kick.\n",
      "This was honestly one of the worst experiences I've had at a restaurant.  At first it seemed alright, but when I got the food it wasn't even that good.  I was also so upset, I asked one of the waiters for a drink and got straight up IGNORED.  Please don't come to this restaurant I am trying to save you from a horrible experience. They had a call button at it literally took them 33 minutes to respond to that when I was in a hurry. This was the first time EVER that I had to give a 0% tip.  They also never told you how long to cook anything either.  I would expect service to be a lot better since they weren't even cooking the food.  Please never eat here, I am doing all of you guys a HUGE favor for warning you guys about this.\n",
      "We just had a horrible meal at this place, usually we came  twice a week that I think we do consider as old faces. Last time we came over total three of us, and one of my friend ate already, asked if she can just have the veg salad that is on side served before dish came. Also we told them twice she is not going to refill. The portion of the salad probably only contain the edges of the leaves and countable. So the manger told us the side was free and yes she can eat the salad only and charge for two person. So this time here we are again, but one of our friend don't feel like eating bbq today so we ask if we are allowed to do what we did last time cause we thought it was still important to clarify with them  that the previous time when we were here we've been told that the salad on side was free, so I can eat that only.  This time the different female manger told us that if I'm a vegetarian that I have to pay half of the price for the veg menu. She continuously trying to convince us that is a vegetarian price, but the original point was asking if she can only eat the salad but nothing else with no refill. We've been told different charge functions of this restaurant, and it is a shame that the female manger doesn't know how to communicate with us, and only concentrate on how to make money instead of having human connection towards to customers. Just a heads up for who will be having mana that make sure to clearly your check before you pay for what you didn't had.\n",
      "First and foremost I was excited to try this place out. I also try a place 3 times just in case they have an off day, I use to be a server, cook, restaurant manager and I understand sometimes the service and food can be off. The food has been pretty good all 3 times, I would rate the food an average of 3.5 out of 5 stars. But the reason why I gave this place 1 star is the horrible service I have received. Just in the last visit we asked our server 4 times for refills on our drinks (they were empty) she rolled her eyes every single time, we asked her for a menu to order more food 3 times, we asked for more rice and reminded our server multiple times about the rice but our server did not bring us our rice until we were going to pay. The server also yelled at my wife for asking to serve her own sesame seed oil since she was busy fixing our burner. She also threw our bill at us, etc. Just horrible service, as a former restaurant manager I have been surprised at the consistent lack of hospitality all 3 times I have visited. I wish them luck and hope they improve their service.\n",

      "Food was nothing special.  Spicy beef noodle had more ham pieces than beef and noodles were very soft. Soup was okay. The red chicken advertised as spicy was literally fried chicken with jarred sweet thai chili sauce drizzled on top. At least there were 10 pieces? Fried squid... two little tentacles served up when the menu picture was clearly something different. \r\n",

On the menu, it doesnt specify that there are peanuts in it anywhere, the worker said there was, but it was the word for potato. The service is horrible, food was alright. They have candles on this tray but doesn't even do anything.\n",
      "The food was OK, maybe 3 stars but the service was horrible.  Although we got seated quickly,  we were without water until our food came.  Anything that we needed we had to ask for it twice. My tea was never refilled and not even one server came back to check on us.  \r\n",

Me and my two girlsfriends visited this place on Saturday night, when we arrived there, we asked if we could stay inside because it was really cold outside plus there were no one else waiting, he refused and said that we'd block the view of another table. We understood and waited outside.  When we were seated however, a group of Koreans came in and the same waiter greeted them, didn't say a word to ask them to wait outside. They stood at the same spot that we were evacuated from. \r\n",

Not to mention how awefully not authentic this food tastes. Everything is overly sweet or oily. The only appeal to this restaurant is its looks, if that is something that you value more than the experience of having ethnic food itself. \r\n",

      "We had lunch box combo which is a nice box with some Korean side dish (tempura and some tofu) and rice. I ordered bulgogi beef. To be fair, the food there is good. Serving size is mediocre for a lunch box. The price is high with ridiculously high tips. Totally eight of us went there and we were forced to be charged a flat tip of over 18% but frankly speaking there was no service at all. In addition, it is the  horrible service that shocked me. The waiter was appallingly rude and stupid without any common sense. At first he could not figure out how many of us wanted ice water and how many wanted hot water. Then when one of my friend had his spicy squid, it was actually chicken. But he was told it was chicken. With doubt, my friend started to eat a little and realized it was indeed CHICKEN. When the waiter realized the mistake and this chicken lunch was meant for another friend of mine, he did something I had never seen in my life. He just WANTED TO HAND that dish to the guy waiting for his chicken even the dish had been eaten by someone else. Of course we requested a new dish should be served to our friend and we finished the lunch without even a water refill. I truly do not believe this type of service is worth any tip but we could not do anything since the so-called gratuity was printed on the bill! In a word, this is a place I would not go again and suggest you guys be aware of the service there.\n",

We ate nothing after all. Absolutely disappointed!\n",
      "I literally downloaded Yelp just to leave this review. I heard of this place through friends who all said that it was relatively good. I came in and was seated pretty quickly because there wasn't a wait. After being seated, our server left us to help other tables who came in AFTER us for 10 minutes without giving us menus so we just sat there and waited (the tables who came in after us got served and left way before us). When he finally gave us our menus, he made us wait another 20 minutes before letting us order (at this point we were ready to leave but decided to stick it out cause you never know if the food is going to be amazingly good). After ordering, our food took ages to arrive and when it did, it came in waves and was mediocre at best. Additionally, we couldn't even start eating until 5 minutes after because our server, yet again, took his time to give us plates, prioritizing other tables over a simple task that should have been completed long before.\r\n",

We were a party of 4 & arrived an hour after opening. We had walked in & the place was already fairly packed. We weren't approached to be seated right away ,instead were told we could sit in the middle area. Five minutes after sitting our waiter came over with 2 menus & we were told they didn't have enough menus for everyone. We all ordered cocktails & literally 10 minutes later they brought over the drinks. After we all took a sip it was another 10 minutes till our waiter came back to take half our order. Our appetizers slowly trickled out, one by one. We were brought 3 plates instead of 4 & were told all of the forks were dirty so none were available. The potstickers & mozzarella sticks had good flavor, but I didn't understand the ketchup dip for the mozzarella sticks. Weird combo.  We never were checked on while our food was cooking. Once the food came out it wasn't at all what we were expecting. Everything was fried & very little sauce if none on all the food. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "All 4 of us were so very unhappy with our experience. We said to each other, we should have just walked over to Macayo's instead. Our final review is, terrible service, horrible food that leaves you feeling unhealthy & greasy, all ending with a $50 tab.  Needless to say, none of us will be returning. But now we have our own opinion everytime we pass by.\n",
      "So, I must admit... I originally went here hoping to scoop myself a hot piece of Korean Man Candy because I was under the impression that it was a bar. It is not a bar. It is a dimly lit restaurant. But the food is delicious, the portions are huge, and they blast kpop, which is the fastest way to my heart.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The real showstopper here is the cheese corn. Which sounds like a venereal disease, but I promise you, it is one of the greatest things I've ever eaten. It's so melty and salty and kind of sweet and greasy and amazing. Their bulgogi is also quite superb and you can tell it's authentic.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The table I was sitting at felt wobbly, the chairs were horrible, and the service was a little slow (there was only one server for the whole restaurant and I could tell he was being overworked) so that's the only reason I'm giving them 4 stars instead of 5. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Overall, this is a solid place and it is 100% worth your money and time. I may have left without the Korean hunk that I was looking for, but I did leave with a full belly and a soju buzz. And that's really all a girl can ask for 짱\\\\_(�깂)_/짱\n",
      "This place has real potential, but unfortantely for them... weird policies and horrible service kills it. I've heard a lot of great things about Honey Pig, but I just don't see where people are getting from.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Honey Pig is slightly different than the other KBBQ places in town. Unlike the other spots, the Pig has huge cast iron dome. They grill most of the side dishes and still leave space for the meats if you order AYCE.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The AYCE has alot of catches. The menu doesn't indicate it, but you can only have one order of the rib-eye, which sucks cause that is usually my favorite dish. I found it odd because pretty much every other AYCE KBBQ joints has unlimited portions of Kalbi. The AYCE is limited to pretty much from 5pm - 10pm. So look to Sura, Woo-che, or Tofu for a light night fix. I found the Bulgogi to be incredibly sweet, seemed like it was over marinated. The spicy pork and beef tongue were on point. The side dish choices are limited and inconsistent. We went one time and they didn't even offer kim-che until we asked for it. WTF?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The service here sucked. We came in for lunch were 1 of 2 parties in the whole restaurant but we still couldn't get decent service. Our server forgot our orders, messed up some of the sauces and we had to hunt her down for re-fills. The 2 times I have been here I have been disappointed, not sure if I can suck it up and come back for a third.\n",
      "Decided to try honey pig for my brother in law's birthday, we got greeted and seated.\r\n",
      "30 mins have past none of the waitress have asked us for drinks. \r\n",
      "But yet another family came in after us and they were served right away with customer service!\r\n",
      "And when i finally got their attention, i told her that we havent been asked for drinks and when she asked me what i want, i told her and walked away pretty fast but she didnt bother asking the rest of the table what they wanted\r\n",
      "My sister in law asked for drinks for her daughter and it took them 20 mins to get it.\r\n",
      "They werent even busy! \r\n",
      "The food was served fast and it was good, \r\n",
      "But there was a point where my bf had meat on his plate, the waitress took the meat back because it wasnt ready! \r\n",
      "I found it very rude.\r\n",
      "And we asked for rice but she said we couldnt have any, until we finish our food.\r\n",
      "I dont know if its because of our race or what, but their customer service was horrible! \r\n",
      "I suggest going to another place!\n",
      "The food is awesome here, but the service is horrible.  I used to go here late night with my restaurant co-worker girlfriends after work and the ladies that work here are total byotches.  It seemed like they were annoyed that we were coming in at 3 am...but they are open 24 hrs, so what's the big deal?  Don't they want to make money?  They looked at me and my friend like we were insane when we ordered a soju AND beer.  They never brought the beer because that was just too much alcohol for two skinny white girls I guess.  Also, never order wine here...not sure what I was thinking...it tasted like pickle juice.  Stick with the Hite.  Anyhow, so me and my earlier mentioned skinny white drinking buddy went in here one eve with our gorgeous husbands and the ladies were totally nice to us, so the guys didn't believe our stories of rude waitresses.  Needless to say, I am a glutton for punishment, as long as the food is delicious.  I don't care about having good service as long as the food is cheap and great.  If it was expensive, I would expect a little more ass kissing.\n",
      "The food deserves five stars. However, I can only.give one because of the poor service. I GET BETTER SERVICE AT MCDONALDS! My friends and I always go there on the weekends after 12am (since they are open til 8:30am) after work to be welcomed by horrible service EVERY TIME:\r\n",
      "- not ONE eye-contact\r\n",
      "- responds with her back towards us\r\n",
      "- maybe she thinks this is her house: serves us food, goes back to her area, sits down with her legs crossed, eats food, and watches TV. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I am sorry to say but we all lose our appetite when.we see her. The only reason we keep going there on Sundays is because we are altogether off. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I hope they change the waitress. Please..\n",
      "First time and last time I'm coming here service is horrible no utensils on the table had to take from another table no rice the waitress said it comes last but never showed up no water refills it wasn't that busy also I'm sure they could have easily served a party of 7 at least all the other Kbbq places we've been to could and they write the tip on the check for you. Only reason we came by is cause someone suggested it at least we know now not to come here ever again 2 stars cause the pork belly the only decent meat they had\n",
      "Food was alright but the service was horrible. If you don't mind horrible service it wouldn't be to bad of a place to eat. Couldn't get anything we ordered the first time we asked. I think it was mostly because of understaffed and it was during a Saturday night. I won't go again but maybe not going on a busy night would make a difference.\n",
      "Very disappointed. Our server was rude, dropped off our food without saying anything and when the grill top got burned, we asked for getting it changed, they said they didn't have any new grill top to change and we gotta use spoons to clean it ourselves. We asked for a towel or something to clean it ourselves and the server ealked away and simply ignored us after that. Also, we were told the A/C wasn't working when we walked in. After 4 more tables came in and the place started getting really hot and smokey, the A/C mysteriously started working. So basically they try to not turn on the air conditioning at night unless the place starts getting too hot. Absolutely horrible service, I recommend staying away from this place. The all we can eat menu is very small options to compare to other places.\n",
      "OMG. The service here is very horrible. A girl waitress(short hair, chinky eyes) was so rude. We asked for some kimchi and she literally just ignored us and left to another table. She just made me feel so sick. Her attitude was so fucked up too.\n",
      "First off, the service is great but the food left all 3 of us with the runs and horrible tummy aches for 2 days!!! We ordered the combo, good for about 2-3 people, which was about $65.  It comes with a variety of meats that aren't marinated, which made the entire meal very bland.  Also, I thought it was weird that we got the fried rice at the end of the meal and only one can of soda for a combo that is apparently good for 2-3 people. Strange... Anywho, doubt I'm ever gonna go back.  My tummy still aches from their food.\n",
      "Food is great,  very very well priced.   Service is horrible!!! I've been 3 times and each time service is worse.   Today we ordered a 35 pot of soup and finished 1/3, they took the pot back and when we asked to have it wrapped up. They said they already threw it out.\n",
      "The bbq is very good, but the service is horrible. They won't tend to you if you're not Korean. I thought it was a figure of my imagination when it happen the first 2 times I went, but nope. The third and last time I ate there was for my dad's birthday. We walked in and was waiting 10 mins because the restaurant looked busy. Another group walked in after that (who were Korean), and the server finally looks over and I told her party of 4. She ignores me and takes the group of 8 behind me. I looked at her in disbelief confronted her that we were waiting first. She finally seats us next to the door. Then they made us wait 20 minutes before giving us a menu and asking what we would like to drink. I will never go back. JIN MEE's restaurant is way better!!!\n",
      "Horobble service,  they would not bring enough meat for the 4 people siting on the table, and the appetizers were not so good, i only liked 2 out of 4 or 5 they have. And i would see all the other tables getting more meat and getting checked that everything was good. Attitude was so bad. Im never coming back here. The brisket was good and the spicy squid, but what do i do with a small plate of that with 4 people  on my table. Horrible horrible horrible\n",
      "It wasn't like other Korean BBQ that I have had. The food is horrible and expensive!! I didn't like the grill being in the middle of my table and I'm the one cooking my own food...I can cook at home.\n",
      "Service is horrible. Had to actually get up from our table and walk over to our server who was just sitting across from us ( ignoring us ever so skillfully) to beg for a refill. Refills became nonexistent after this. She dumped all entrees on grill at one time,didn't explain anything to us. My family has never been to a place like this; so a little explanation would have been nice if not helpful. Seafood and chicken were just dumped on grill together. If I could I would give this place no stars. We are a big family that enjoys getting together and eating out. We will never come back to this place again. Be prepared to be ignored than snarled at in Korean for asking for service that your overpaying for.  I've gotten better service at a Panda Express.\n",
      "This is horrible service.!sitting table no body care us. I don't want to come this here again\n",
      "So the service was horrible. Want a full house and no help in site. Had to look for a waitress sometimes.the meat quality was decent.\n",
      "I love korean BBQ. Like I've mentioned in my other reviews, this is the only food I'll never get tired of eating. I've never heard nor been to this place so I told my bf hey babe, let check this out. Lets see if its any good.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So we walked in around 7pm and the place wasn't busy at all. Surprisingly. . Usually, kbbq places are packed on a friday and saturday night. We were seated to our booth. The door was open at the back close to where we were sitting. Told the server if she can close the door because it was cold so she did.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We looked at the menu we did the regular which had most meat and seafood selections. Price was $21 AYCE from what I remember. It was decent.. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We got kalbi, shrimp, thin sliced beef, and pork ribs for our for our first order. They all came to our table within 10 mins. We started grilling and eating. Man everything had no taste. They gave us salt and pepper as dipping sauces. It didn't even help. The server opened the door again which pissed me off because I told them we were cold.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Service also sucked here because they didn't check on us. Our grill was burning. It needed to be changed but nope no one checked on us. Couldn't even place another order because of that. I was thirsty for more water but they took so freakin long. Ugh! I am not coming back here. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Food was horrible plus service. Enough said. Get your crap together..\n",
      "I come here all the time to eat with my boyfriend and we usually have the same girl server every time I wish I remembered her name but she is amazing. This time we had someone named Steve whoever he is he is just plain horrible. The last time we came he appeared to be hostessing and serving he always looks like such a damn stress case I myself work in the food industry and it's really not that hard to take care of FOUR tables by yourself. The last time we came he let me and my boyfriend stand at the host stand for 30 MINUTES without even acknowledging us. Unbelievable. I proceeded to say excuse me sir multiple times and he straight up ignored me. Causing the two parties behind us to just leave and go somewhere else. This time we came in he was the only server working at the time he only had 3 tables including us. Doesn't even greet us just throws the stuff on the table and says are you ready to order. Then it wasn't so bad he took a while but eventually got us what we needed. It wasn't until I asked for the check now this FUCKING pissed me off. The bill was 37.83 so I paid in cash and I gave him 7.75 as I was putting my quarters in the check book because that 75 cents makes ALL the difference in the percentage of tipping he had the AUDACITY to tell me oh I don't NEED your pennies.... EXCUSE ME I said what did you just say to me?! I am giving you a tip? And he goes it's not like I'm poor or something... what an ungrateful piece of shit ARE YOU KIDDING ME. Now I am a server myself and I would never say something like that to someone even if they tip me a single penny I am grateful for anything that I receive. Now something needs to be done about this man because this is absolutely unacceptable. I will not stop until he gets the repercussions he deserves. This is my favorite place to go and because of you STEVE. You just lost a very loyal customer BBQ HOUSE.\n",
      "We tried this place out for my son's 13th birthday. It was fun for him to grill our dinner....it was a good family experience.  BUT when you're spending $20+ per person AND you have to cook your own dinner with little instruction I expect the quality of the food to be very high, it was moderate.  The smoke from the grill was horrible, the evac systems didn't work, but hey there was an old fan on the ground that only blew the smoke in to my son's eyes.  I was really looking forward to the cheese corn, it was not cheesey and gooey like all the pictures and videos I had seen, bummer. This is not something that I will be seeking out.\n",
      "First, the meat quality was horrible. you could tell it was all dried up and had been in the freezer for forever. Second, the service was extremely slow. We were there around 3pm so there weren't even that many customers, but the servers were very unresponsive and not friendly. Wouldn't recommend to anyone, and I wouldn't go back myself\n",
      "I have been looking for good Korean bars/eateries since I left the SF Bay Area. Unfortunately, this is not the one. Absolutely horrible. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Bad food; too greasy and bland. Our server was very weird as well. One of my friends ordered fire chicken bowl: What a horrible dish! Dry chicken pieces swimming on a grease pool and overcooked noodles. Of course, we sent it back. The server said she had to charge it. We said OK; then she changed her mind and didn't charge it. We wanted to order another Kalbi but they were out; we wanted Bulgogi instead but they were out. The explanation was they were really busy two days ago. Imagine the freshness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Just don't go.\n",
      "Number one most important thing you need to know: See that button on your table that looks like half of a tiny bowling ball? It's a kind of door bell. Why? If you're wondering why servers are walking past you, ignoring your eager expressions, it's because unless you ring the bell, the (really busy, hard working) servers don't know you need anything. Some Korean friends brought me here when they opened (a few years ago now, despite the fact that they've had their Grand Opening sign up for a few years, but whatevs) and I feel like a horrible person for not reviewing this place sooner! I have been coming here ever since they opened and (after trying many other AYCE Korean BBQ places in the city). Why mess with perfection? After trying a selection of the different meat grilling choices, I stick to my fave - Samgyeopsal (pork belly - sounds gross, totally isn't - it's consistency is a bit like peameal - only better, well, you've just gotta try it). I can be convinced (yeah, forced, twist my rubber arm-like) to come here ANY TIME for Samgyeopsal. So, expect to have your clothes smell like grilled meat (hell, I'd pay for that bonus alone) - and many of the in table cookers don't work, so the server will bring a table top one. If, for some reason, the flame on it doesn't work that just means that the can of fuel has run out - ring the bell, the server can fix it in a jif! If you go when it's busy, the room will be smoky, the servers will be running around like crazy, but hey, it's a popular place. Secret tip: I like to go at odd times like 3 or 4 p.m. when it's empty and we can be guaranteed one of the little side rooms, rather than a table in the middle of the floor. There's always a Korean variety show playing on both tvs. The bathroom is downstairs (door next to atm in the entryway). Okay, so here is how you do it (for the maximum satisfaction Korean BBQ experience): 1. Get seated, don't bother with a menu - just tell em you want the AYCE Samgyeopsal . If you go with 4 or more people (who are, of course, all having AYCE), there seems to be a deal that includes 4 beer/a bottle of soju, but I'm not totally clear on the parameters. 2. The server will bring the table top burner a plate of raw meat and side dishes, along with shredded green onions in a red sauce, lettuce leaves and a rectangular dish with what looks like oil in one half and sauce on the other. 3. Once the server turns on the burner, use the (thoughtfully provided scissors) to slice the meat in half (trust me, I've got this down to a science), toss it on the grill - ask for an extra plate (to place grilled meat on when it's done). 4. Once the meat is done, take a lettuce leaf in the palm of your hand, place some meat on the leaf, then shredded green onion, and a bit of the thicker sauce (from rectangular plate) then wrap it up like a baby burrito, dip the end of it in the clearish sauce (found on other side of rectangular plate). Mmmmmmm!!  Oh, and tip well please - these kids who are servers never stop for a second, are always on the go and professional as well. Enjoy!\n",
      "I know you might still give this restaurant a shot despite all the bad reviews. However you might be making a really bad choice because I was going through the same phase and the nightmare began:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The restaurant was horrible in general. The worst service to start with: it took them 15 minutes to start serving us (with a 2 hour seating limit) while we were just sitting there looking If anyone would come (didn't even give us water). We chose the all you can eat Combo B (Combo A only comes with pork), since my boyfriend doesn't eat pork. The waiter didn't even ask what we wanted from the combo and went ahead and served us a plate of pork with a little bit of beef. When I told him that my boyfriend does not eat pork and he just laughed and said my boyfriend could focus on the beef and I could be eating the pork. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We asked for more beef and chicken, and he told us that they needed to change the grill pan for bulgogi and chicken, and we wouldn't be able to grill the pork anymore. Therefore, even though I do not eat that much pork on a daily basis, I still forced myself to eat more or the food would just go to waste. We finished all the beef that was served, and as much pork as I could, and then asked for bulgogi and chicken again. The waiter not only did not change the grill pan but also told us that we had to finish the pork before we could order more. We told him that we never wanted the pork initially, and he took the pork away unpleasantly. We did not get our chicken without asking again, and our grill pan was never changed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The taste of the food was okay, compared to all other amazing Korean restaurants in K-Town. The menu states that our combo comes with a pop but most likely you won't get it unless you ask. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We'll never come back here again since there are so many amazing K bbq restaurants in Toronto.\n",
      "The restaurant meat quality and food taste is horrible :( Also we order combo menu, whereas we donnot eat pork but they don't have any option for us to choose chicken, beef or pork.. \r\n",
      "two years ago when l had been there everything was so delicious however at this time my friends and l was so disappointed\n",
      "This restaurant was not worth the price of it!! So we tried the eat all you can and there are two options for it. First option is 2 meats (2 types of pork) and second option is 4 meats (2 types of beef and 2 types of pork). We got the 4 meat which was around $23.99. With each option you get a cup of rice and soup. The price you're paying for only 4 meats that did not taste anything at all!! It was so bland that you had to use the paste that they gave u in the side dishes. What was even more horrible is the fact that if you want another cup of rice, it's an extra dollar!!! Overall, I would not go to this restaurant again.\r\n",
      "Side note: staff was friendly.\n",
      "I came here on a Saturday night with Anastasiya, Agata, Gayle and another friend. We chose this place because it was right next to christie station and it had just started snowing, so we didn't really wanna walk anywhere else.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The first thing you notice when you walk in here is the SMOKE. This place is like walking into a smoky cloud. The ceilings are super low and the ventilation was horrible.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Anyways, we got to sit in a semi private booth, meaning that we shared it with another table but it was private.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Agata and I both had the Gamjatang, and Anastasiya and her friend had the soon tofu and some seafood dish.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The ban chan were okay.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Gamjatang was lack lustre, even though I asked for extra spicy, I feel like it had no kick.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But here's the kicker...soon after both Agata and I got sick. I rarely ever get sick from non-dairy related foods cuz man's got a stomach of steel...but it happened. Not the best.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So yea, that happened.\n",
      "We were very excited to discover a new Korean BBQ place, my co-worker and I.  Unfortunately, we went there today and after the treatment we received from the server, Yoojeong L, we will NEVER go back.  \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It started when we were a bit early and it was very windy and cold outside. The door was unlocked and she was going to make us wait outside until I pleaded with her to let us wait inside.  She rolled her eyes at us and walked away.  Another server came and actually let us sit down at our table, explaining that the kitchen wouldn't be open for another 5 minutes.  We were fine with that.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When YL came, she didn't ask us if we had ever experienced Korean BBQ like every other place does.  She just asked us what we wanted. She provided us with sauces and didn't explain what they were.  I asked what the big ceramic dish was and she said that was the grill.  I said I hadn't seen anything like that and thought the grill was on the left. She said that was for stew.  \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The entire meal continued like this.  She would roll her eyes like she was disgusted at having to serve us; almost in a discriminatory way.  \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her attitude was horrible and the food wasn't even that good so, we will never be back and we will tell our our Korean BBQ-loving friends and family about our experience.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "You'd think a place that has only been open a month would have better customer service if they want to build a customer base and have the customers come back on a recurring basis.  I guess NOT.\n",
      "Not sure if people are reviewing the bar, but yelp kicked me in the balls with this one. Meat low quality, service very unfriendly and so confusing with 5 people coming by every few minutes and not getting some of what we ordered. They kept bringing us marinated meat we never ordered taste like cheep very sweet teriyaki cooks out of meat and burns on pan in front of you leaving horrible smell. Lastly there's not any kind of BBQ involved here. It's literally a gas burner with a flat pan on it which isn't hot enough to even sear off the meat. I would never cook steak in a pan ever, unless it was a big fat steak in a very very hot cast iron. It was a chore to eat here very unenjoyable. Like I said pretty much all the employees looked miserable the only smile we got was when we left. Sauce that come with it taste like 2 teriyaki sauces over sweet and thick and one salty like soy no other flavor. Just disappointing.\n",
      "My brother had been wanting to eat at this KBBQ place for a while now, but wasn't able to go till this past weekend because he said the line was so long every time he's tried to eat here. So, this past weekend was the first for my him and my whole family. (we arrived just minutes before they opened after church) The service was good. Different servers kept coming to our table checking to see if we needed anything. Unfortunately, the food was probably my least favorite KBBQ. I can't really explain why. It's not horrible, but it's just not one of my top 5 places.\n",
      "Omg I love this place so much. So many good things here! So I came with a party of 4 on Friday night around 7pm and there was about a 45 minute wait which isn't horrible. The restaurant is in a good location so there are other places/things to do (bakeries, boba, other stores, etc). They also have a bar in the front if you want to drink while you wait. So once we were seated we decided to choose the Prime B option. Most of the meats are very good quality but I have to say my favorites were the rib eye, the pork belly sampler (specifically the curry one), the prime chuck garlic (sooo much garlic - which I love), and the kalbi. All just so perfectly flavored and delicious. I think I got a little greedy and ate most of the meat on some these I mentioned lol. Also, I know some people like to not fill up on the appetizers, but I'm the opposite I LOVE appetizers. And they have so many good ones. The corn cheese, wings, cream cheese wontons, chicken karaage were all heavenly. Even the steam egg had more flavor that what I'm used to at other KBBQ places. \r\n",
      "So this was my first time at a place that has a stone grill but its nice because if you clean it regularly (for which they give you a chunk of radish) it won't have burnt residue left behind. My friend says it helps the meat taste better? I don't know but I thought it was all great, nothing bad to say. Worth the money for sure. Service was also great and I think our server was great. She has a good memory...idk how she remembers a million things without a note pad haha! Anyway, I'll be back for sure this place is amazing.\n",
      "The food was good unfortunately the service was horrible. Our waitress was incredible rude she was working the booths near the door with light brown hair, forgot her name. She made snippy and rude comments about what we ordered and when we asked questions about the menu items. I won't be back\n",
      "I used be live las vegas and now i visit las vegas twice a year and I always like to try new restaurants. I found this restaurant at yelp and have almost 4.5 star so I tried tonite and It was big mistake!! We ordered AYCE- A type. I got beef tongue, brisket, pork belly, intense.....OMG, so horrible. The quality is so BAD!! Their salad is bad, all appetizers are taste so bad too. We just sit there and 30mins after we just left. We just waste 22.95! Per each!!\n",
      "We went out tonight for our anniversary. I came across this place on Yelp and the reviews brought me in. We did go around dinner time and had to wait a good while to he seated. That was the biggest downfall all night. Once we got seated, everything turned around. The food was great. They have three different options to choose from for the ayce. We went with the middle one and it didn't disappoint. There was a good variety of food to choose from. The filet mignon was really good. They told us to give one of the soups a try because they're a big hit. We were iffy about them since they weren't the types of soups we'd normally go for, but we tried the seafood one. It actually had a really nice flavor. What I really like about this place, is that they don't charge for leftovers, so if you do get something you don't like, you don't have to finish it. The staff was very attentive and always checking up on us when they saw that our plates were near empty. I'm so glad the service was great because the last korean bbq place we went to, was horrible and we worried about it being so busy. They're located in chinatown near the mall. By the time we were getting ready to be seated, there were a lot of people hanging around outside waiting for a table. Make sure you get there early, if you're planning on going on a weekend, during prime dinner time hours.\n",
      "Used to love this place and came all the time. Came in tonight with a party of ten.  Food was mediocre, service was horrible!! They never came back to check on us, never refilled the Kim Chi and charged an automatic gratuity.\n",
      "I believe this has changed owners and is now called arrirang??? I am mixed about this place. The service is always horrible no matter what server you get. How many times do we need to call you over before you come and check on us?? The food is so yummy though. So many side dishes to choose from if you don't like one. So many different meat option and you get to cook it right on the grill at the table.   One thing that always bothers me is all of the severs take the cover off the grill and then set it on the floor. That is soooo unsanitary! I'm not sure if they take it to get cleaned afterwards but I doubt it.   Also I always seem to have a stomach ache afterwards.  Last time we order ham and the grease was falling into the grill causing large flames. Our server freaked out and said she was going to run to the kitchen to get water. My friend calmly stood up and moved the ham to the side so it couldn't drip down.... I was surprised the fire alarm didn't go off.\n",
      "What can be said? I've been going to the restaurant for years... YEARS! But yesterday I was thoroughly disappointed. The food has taken a major turn for the worst... Gone is the freshness, gone is the cleanliness and GONE is the tastiness. Sushi: We ordered Sashimi and a couple of roles. The one thing you expect from Sushi is freshness... Takamatsu sushi had all the indicators of DAYS in the fridge.  It was beyond belief. The fish was stale and gray. The GINGER! This stuff comes from bottles was old and smelled like pine sol... Come on man. I could have brought in fresher ginger.  Now to the main course. The bulgogi... The mainstay of Korean food... horrible. HORRIBLE I SAY. This was not bulgogi. This was super thinly sliced beef, god I hope it was beef, that had been stored in fridge and they later found and decided not to let it go to waste.  Side dishes were okay, but lacked flavor and freshness. Lastly comes the cleanliness. This should be the easiest thing to achieve in a restaurant. Don't need a pricey chef, waiter or creativity... Just need a bucket, cleaning solution, a mop and some backbone. Don't go near the bathrooms or you will find your shoes stuck to the floor like a roach motel. Don't believe me, take a sticky strole passed the sushi bar. After all was said and done and paid my fine of ~$80 to be released from Takamatsu. Lets put it this way fellow foodies. If I knew the food tasted this badly they could not have paid me $80 to eat it. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Takamatsi is an embarrassment to honest Korean Restaurants in the valley.  They should close or get their act together before someone is hurt badly with their food.  If you decide to go there and get disappointed, don't blame me. I tried my best to provide you a fair warning. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thus my review... \r\n",
      "Service great  \r\n",
      "Price: $80 for two adults\r\n",
      "Cleanliness:     ...............\r\n",
      "Food Bad.... VERY Bad\n",
      "Service is horrible. Korean BBQ is good, a bit over priced. All you can eat sushi is good. The decor of the restaurant could use a bit of a remodel. Korean food is mediocre for a restaurant stating its specialty in Korean food.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I've been there twice. But the second time was my final visit.\n",
      "I had a korean bbq craving because I was so use to eating it so often in the Orange County, CA.  They must have had over 20 within a 10 mile radius, so with that said.. I can safely say that I have the ability to judge good or bad quality of meat.  The panchan was about the only good thing we got... the service is horrible, ignored over 10 times, took over 30 mins to get our check.  We ordered the brisket and pork belly.  When the order was brough over it was brownish... so I though eh if you cook it it will be fine.. WRONG. Both the brisket and pork belly was dry as sandpaper the sauces did not help.  It surprises me that porkbelly can be so dry?! The grill kept getting sticky but it took forever to flag a waiter down to change it.  I have yet to try the sushi but I will definately be sticking to CA for korean bbq now.  \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Pretty pricey too for such low quality meat.\n",
      "The only place I would want to go for Korean food in Arizona especially on weekdays for their lunch specials [:\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The service can be rude. If I go with my aunt, who is a regular there, we get really good service from everyone but if we go without her, we get less then stellar service. Although the boss is amazing! He has very good memory and remembers what we order and is always very nice and he remembers us.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As for the food, it is delicious. I would recommend everyone to go during lunch time for their lunch specials. Lots of food for around 7-9 bucks. Not bad. And I love the ban chan (appetizers?) they give out in the beginning but I think they are catching on that we will devour it and they would have to refill it so they bring it out close to/when our meal comes to the table.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "If you want good Korean food, go here!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oh Edited: Had the sushi a couple of times here, dont recommend it. Its not horrible but not awesome either. Its not cheap so if you want sushi, just go somewhere with delicious sushi.\n",
      "Definitely the last time I come here. I used to be a regular but now the customer service is so bad it's ridiculous. And ever since Richard the old owner left, the service only gotten worst and the food quality itself dropped. Spicy pork is full of fat. The bulgoli is dry and livery tasting. If the food was good and the service is bad, I would still man it out and come here but now that both is horrible, no reason in coming back. After 5 years it's time to say goodbye.\n",
      "This place had the rudest customer service, it was horrible! We came to celebrate a birthday and drove all the way from the west side of town just to try out the place. We noticed they forgot a couple dishes and we asked the server. He finally went to put in the order. We asked 3-4x about the dish and it never came out until we were done with the rest of our meal. The workers were sitting around giving each other massages when we were the only party there and never really serving us. We asked if the dish can be comped since it wasn't our fault. The server yelled at us and told us that we should have cancelled the order if we didn't want it anymore next time. I told him that there won't be a next time. On top he made a really big deal about paying with split checks. Even charged us a gratuity for something the place didn't deserve!\n",
      "Food was okay for noodle and dumpling but I saw portion of some noodle combo menus. That was not worth it to pay that extra money for it. The meet portion was really small. Also, the service was bad. I mean horrible. Server was looks like the owner. And she was yelling to the peopele in the kitchen. And she was rude. When she serve the food, she just left the food on the table without say anything. Asked cold water but didn't give to me until I asked again (we was serving and take order from other table for more than 10 mins until I ask again). We had to grab the napkins because she didn't give anything after spill water on the table even she saw it. When we left, she didn't say a word even she was right on my table to clean. Just for the noodle and dumpling, I don't mind the food but will never go back just because of the owner service and unprofessinality. We were so uncomfortable to seat and eat since she was yelling to kitchen. And never smile to customers. I'm so regret that I gave her okay tips.\n",
      "The food itself was ok, but the service was horrible. It seemed like we were ignored because we weren't Korean. Towards the end of our meal, I realized that we weren't even offered any water while every other table had a bottle... what kind of restaurant doesn't offer water? The waiters ignored our table and I had to walk up to the front to pay the bill. I will not be returning.\n",
      "It's ok. Nothing really to write home about here. The service leaves much to be desired but it is a dive Korean style restaurant.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "You can't get Korean food here they pretty much just make the fried chicken and chicken wings. We asked for it extreme spicy wish very rarely in this town will be a spicy dish but this one actually was. On the downside The seasoning was just over-the-top and really thick and cakes on. It was extremely spicy though. Which was good.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The wings were very bland and we didn't care for those. The eggrolls were pretty horrible.\n",
      "My girlfriend and I came in for dinner as we were starving! We got sat quite fast considering the restaurant was busy. My girlfriend ordered pork bone soup which was the main reason why we stopped by, because she loves it! :) so i tried a new item on the menu and an app for the both of us. Food came really fast both the app and the main entrees. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The app was good, my girl friend finished her pork bone, but i didnt take more than 4 bites out of my noodle soup. It was bland and tasteless. I forget the name of my entree but it read noodles,mixed veggies and chicken broth. It was like ordering water off the menu for $8.99 because the soup was like water, no flavour at all, chicken broth i got in my noodle soup was certainly less than an ounce which is really misleading and annoying. It was like 5 pieces of chicken the size of your pinky nail... I told one of the servers about my experience with the meal and he obnoxiously, rudely and un hesitantly said I can't order something on the menu and say you dont like it.. He insisted that i had to pay for it and made a scene knowing the restaurant was kinda packed. I of-course felt uncomfortably and did not want to pay for something that i did not enjoy and on top of all, it was a new item on the menu. Service went horrible after that.. We left no tip at all. Ruined our day because the server attacked my girlfriend with the same speech.. \r\n",
      "After an annoying lecture about what we ordered and what WE did wrong.. We decided to pay for the bill and leave no tip. \r\n",
      "Definitely not coming back here EVER. \r\n",
      "Not recommended.\n",
      "The pork bone soup is ok, but I can get the same at a lower price at food court like First Markham Place. Besides, service is horrible. The old waitress here is rude. She insisted to take my credit card and pay the bill by herself. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Horrible service! Won't be coming back!\n",
      "I've been to other owl's ... and this location is by far the worst. Although their food is decent their service was horrible and it was really dark in there today - the only lights that were on were the ones on the wall which were pictures of their food...and I know they aint trying to set the mood and be all romantic lol. We had to try to flag them down multiple times to order. They would take orders from other tables who arrived after we did. We ordered kimchi fried rice and kalbi. The kimchi fried rice came out..and we starting munching on that....and we got through half of it...and called the server over ...and they totally forgot about our order of kalbi. They even forgot about the order from the table next to us as well. The button on the wall to call for service obviously doesn't work. The ladies serving look miserable and it's starting to show in their service.\n",

      "- dish had a distinct taste of cigarette ash\r\n",
      "- I paid in cash and before I was able to collect my change, the waitress tried to take the money away and asked (still rudely) if I was going to leave her a 40% tip. After I told her no, she was literally moving the tip tray away from me as I was gathering up my money (I ended up tipping 20% which was against my will)\r\n",

      "Save yourself the money, headache and stomache, and go to another Korean restaurant that treats you with basic decency and serves better food. Owl of Minerva? Pass.\n",
      "First of all this place is in dire need of some renovations. Upkeep of a restaurant is very important to me and this place just looks run-down and messy. The furniture is run-down, the walls are run-down and the floors are run-down, just horrible! Even the dishes were falling apart.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Just ordered the pork bone soup, honestly nothing special just standard stuff. I feel like the prices have definitely gone up and I believe the pork bone soup is cheaper at some of the neighbouring places. I couldn't even find a piece of potato.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The service was really meh. You can tell I really don't like this place. They have a small selection of side dishes (This is why I come to Korean restaurants, side dishes!!!) We came in from the back entrance and it smelled kind of funny. I really hope I don't have to come back because someone in my group thinks this is the best place for pork bone soup!\n",
      "Been here thrice now but our service tonight has just been horrible. Our food took more than half an hour to come and the server seemed more engrossed in watching TV than even offering to refill our glasses. Don't come here in the evenings!!. They're just really stressed and will stress you out too.\n",
      "This is one of my go to Korean Restaurants in Glendale. Serves traditional dishes prepared and presented traditionally. On this particular visit the credit card service was down and only accepted cash. Just in case your visiting soon. \r\n",
      "The feel is always very traditional and the decor adds to the feel of the times I ate in Seoul. \r\n",
      "Today I had the Hot Bipimpap. One on my favorite Korean dishes. As always it was delicious and served just like I was in South Korea. The only thing I must point out and I'm just really getting nit picky is the beef did not have the soft fresh taste as this restaurant always has in the past. Aside from that I am pleased with the taste of my meal and the endless sides of Kimshi, and all the other sides traditionally served.\r\n",
      "The prices are comparable to any other Korean place around the valley. Fair prices without going overboard. \r\n",
      "One thing I really appreciate is it's always clean. Never been here and it's dirty. Even when it's busy. \r\n",
      "Oh and the water tasted good.  No tap horrible flavor making me want to buy a bottled water.\n",
      "Food is okay but their service was horrible. I ordered a fried ice cream after meal and the waitress apparently being so annoyed and she said it would take very long because the restaurant was very busy. But the restaurant didn't seem packed.\n",
      "My wife and I wanted some quick, cheap Korean food and thought to try this restaurant. We walked in and the waitress just stared at us without any greeting. We were placed right beside the door and asked if we could get a booth. The waitress did not even acknowledge my request and walked away even though she clearly heard. Do not go to this restaurant! Service is horrible even for Asian standards.\n",
      "The food at this AYCE Kbbq is great. Seasoning and marinate is terrific. The service is not the best. We had to reorder the same items 4 times. It could have a language issue..but the food made up for it. Atmosphere is decent and you're not cramped in like other kbbq places. The chairs are horrible and are sunken down due to heavy usage. Not the most comfortable.  Ask for the booth with the benches.\n",
      "Food is okay.  Service is quite horrible (servers are never there and food serving is really slow). Prices is reasonable compared to other Korean restaurant.  Quite disappointed and will not return.\n",
      "OMG everything here is cloyingly sweet. This is not good Korean food. From the kimchi to the bulgogi, any possible flavors are overpowered by the added sugar. This is like the Sriracha of Korean food. One star might seem harsh, but it's a finger in the dike toward this horrible trend sweeping across casual Korean food in the US. This is me taking a stand.\n",
      "Don't know what the fuss is about, the soon dubu jjigae is not all that great here. OK, it's decent but i've had wayyyy better. This franchise is actually a smaller shop compared to the other BCD's in the states. They don't offer the combo menu where you get grilled meat AND soon dubu. They don't even have Kalbi. What a shame. There was a huge line though, but i think because this place might be somewhat new and people go for the name. NOT THE SAME BCD as the rest of the chain, be warned. My Bulgogi was not all that awesome and the sides were horrible. Im glad in seattle there are korean people everywhere and the food is amazing. Sorry BCD Toronto, Im not a fan.\n",
      "Service was horrible. I knew things were going bad when the waiter started moving our table without saying a word. I was resting my arm on the table when out of no where the waiter starts pulling my table away. Things got worse when another waiter started clearing another table and instead of putting the other table's things on a cart, he proceeded to put another table's bottles and cups on our table! WTF! When we were ready to finally order I wanted to get a dish a little spicier (which they've done before) he told me that they don't do that any more. WTF! I only came to this place a second time because my friend wanted to try it but I'm never coming back here again. The food was ok but the service sucked!\n",
      "It wasnt amazing. It wasn't horrible. But wasn't memorable enough for me to recommend to my friends. It's a cute, dimly lit spot - good for dates. The dishes were well plated but fell short in terms of flavour, kinda bland for Korean food. We had the octopus, the grilled eggplant, the mangadak, and ssam. We had two drinks each. About $55/pp.\n",

      "First time I tried the food it was horrible. I tried out their noodle dishes and they tasted bland like water. I think Arirang, Woorijib, and Bab Plus nearby serve much better food than this.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Second time I visited here I didn't even get my food for an hour. When I asked at the counter what was taking so long they said they already served my food. They never even called out my number or showed my number on the display above the counter. I complained to the manager about this and he tried to play it off as though someone had taken my food by accident, and the cashier tried to put the blame on me for not paying attention. Absolutely ridiculous! I was there alone and watching the display to show my number and it never did! The cashier never called out the number either. I demanded a refund which they were prompt about, but I am never going to go back there again.\r\n",

      "Worst Korean fusion restaurant in Urbana. Go eat elsewhere for better food and better service. The manager at Arirang calls out the number in a prompt manner, and the food tastes much better at Woorijib.\n",
      "The food here is very good! Big bowl of seafood soup! The cashier lady had a very horrible attitude! Didn't smile didn't even want to answer our questions! She basically ruined the experience! To the Asian cashier lady....you need to cheer up or quit your job.\n",
      "Terrible attitude. They ALWAYS give the wrong order! After the third time they gave me the wrong dish, I pointed out, they suggested i didn't say clearly! Their food is not cheap either, plus the horrible attitude, good luck if you choose to come here.\n",
      "This place is rarely busy and the food is the reason. We were not impressed with any of the 6 entrees we ordered. It was inexpensive, comparatively speaking, but it was bad... it would have been horrible if it were free. The service was good, which is the only reason I gave it a 2 star rating.\n",

      "I overall enjoy B Won. Whenever I go to a Korean restaurant I always get their Chap-Che and I was not disappointed. I am going to keep this review nice and short, compared to other reviews on this page. B Won is a good place in champaign to get some quality Korean food. The staff however may not be as friendly. Long story short, my mom is Korean and she hates this place because they were mean and horrible in service. I however had great service and they were super friendly. GO TO B WON AND TRY THEIR CHAP-CHE!!!! Oh and I love their side dishes w/ every meal.\n",
      "Let me tell you that their food is amazing. But I give it one star because the service is absolutely horrible. First of all it's slow. They barley come around to your table to ask how the food is or if you need a drink refill. You always have to wave them down. I would only come here if I was on a budget for Korean all you can eat as you can't beat the prices. But expect horrible service.\n",
      "My experience at sura was horrible. It was our first and our last time there. If I could put a negative star I would. We get in at about 335pm and were sat at a table. I go to get food (vegetable tempura shumai and egg foo young) well I take a seat back at the table and take a bite out of the tempura and about to take another bite and that's when I look down at my food and see a hair in my food. I pull at the hair and it ended up being a 2inch piece of hair. I told the first waitress and she apologized and took my plate away.. Ok so moving forward with our lunch not having an appetite to eat much I go and take a piece of my Kim chee and under that piece there was a piece of hair.. Talk about being disgusted.. I tell another waitress and she tells the owner and the owner comes to the table and was like I'm sorry blah blah blah.. Then the owner and waitress started to talk in their language and started to laugh looking at the plate.. Talk about feeling like crap as being the customer.. Then the owner goes well it could be your hair.. That was it, I was being so nice and professional with the whole matter after all it wasn't my fault and believe me we have the money to pay for our meal so trying to get a free meal is something I was not trying to do. With this happening twice in one sitting I am sure that I will not be returning to this place again.. Trust me it pays off to look at your food so stuff like this doesn't happen and your not eating someone else's disgusting hair..\n",

In addition, it is buffet style and they have sushi, salad, dessert, etc. My favorite is the kimchi. You can also get lettuce to wrap your meat if you like eating it this way. Service is OK but it's an all you can eat buffet style restaurant so what do you expect? Price was $25/person that last time I was there, not sure if it went up since then... overall would highly recommend.\n",
      "Don't care if they have horrible service or not. This place has AMAZING Korean food. LEGIT Korean food. Each side dish was so impressive and meat were good quality too. For us, our server constantly checked on us to see if we need anything and she was super friendly. Probably the best korean bbq in Vegas. I definitely recommend this place!\n",
      "I would give zero stars if I could. AVOID THIS PLACE . here's my top reasons why:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "1) my HOT tea was served in a plastic cup twice until I asked them to put it in a mug.\r\n",
      "2) there is NO brisket. It looks like brisket, but it really isn't, it's really eye of round which is WAY cheaper than actual brisket.\r\n",
      "3) EVERYTHING. From the incompetent servers to the food--horrible.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Don't be fooled by this restaurant. There's a reason why there are only few customers coming. Obviously, it's because the food is below sub par. I'm amazed at how this place can stay in business. Maybe it's cause they use cheap quality food.\n",
      "I've been to Sura several times before, but have never written a review, here it goes...\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Location: Sura has a huge open parking area, most restaurants on Spring Mountain have horrible parking spaces!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ambiance: The dinning area is spacious,  well kept, and clean. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Food: I love the bulgogi and the short ribs are delicious. I enjoy the fact that it's all you can eat, in addition to it's affordable price.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The only upside to Sura, is the fact that the waiters don't change the grill until they're asked to do so.\n",
      "I checked this place out with my boyfriend after we hit up the gym.  We didn't have too high expectations but man I have to say this place is horrible. The meats were not fresh, and the pork belly just tasted strange.  It was clean, but there didn't seem to be too much traffic coming through. The lack of customers should've been a red flag. For the price we paid I do not feel this place was worth the money.\n",
      "came here after leaving mothers grill (horrible restaurant btw) and had a great time! There was so much variety in meat and soups! we ate so much.. the only compliant i have is that when our water and tea was low i had to get up and find a waiter... didnt like that\n",
      "The food was horrible!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The servers were kind and friendly!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The had a buffet-style banchan bar.. and the best banchan was the baked corns and korean sweet potatos. The food were taste-less. The prices were outrageous.\r\n",
      "We ordered, 2 types of korean chigae, 2 types of naengmyun and korean seafood pancakes(pa chun).\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The chigaes were screaming M S G!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\r\n",
      "I'm sure all korean restaurants use MSG but it was nothing but MSG.\r\n",
      "The mool naengmyung tasted like 7 UP. I had to put so much vinegar and mustard to make some kind of flavor out of it but was still horrible.\r\n",
      "The bibim naengmyun was not any better.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I would give the seafood pachun 3 stars though. The soysauce was pretty good. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But for that money, will never go bad. I paid appx $30 dollars more the night before at the buffet for 4.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "WE ordered 5 entrees and the bill came out to $155. I would not go back.\n",
      "Ok I order cold noodle and ribs, even i can make it better, just bad! Service is horrible!!!....very pricy.  Not recommend!!! I wish I had hotel buffet or good sushi! Yesterday I went island style restaurant that i found,   Just try island style restaurant, they are so good and good price!!!\r\n",
      "Two thumb down for this place, he'll NO!!!!\n",
      "I've been going to this place for almost 8 years now with my family every year when we go to Vegas. I am Korean so I know what authenticity tastes like. Everytime we went it was more than satisfying especially the side dish bar which allows for an endless amount of side dishes. However this time it was absolutely horrible. We ordered the yookgaejang and it smelt rotten, the mandoogook used packaged dumplings (which they did not do before) and on top of that it was the wrong dumplings, the soondae was not hot enough leaving my egg yolk raw, the eundaegoo was uncooked and numerous other things. Don't waste your time. I wouldn't nor my money.\n",
      "If you're not Korean this isn't the spot to come to, they make you feel like an outsider, and the service is horrible. Food is good though, but I wouldn't recommend it.\n",
      "Horrible, horrible service. I'm not Asian or white, so the hostess decided to pretend I wasn't there, and only spoke to and seated everyone else who came. After three separate groups got service, and the forth actually pointed to me as being next (I was already fishing out my keys), she sighed and asked what I wanted. I excused myself and left. So while I'm sure the food has potential to be good, I didn't trust they would actually give it to me.  My daughter, who was very hungry, simply cried. We hadn't expected such open racism when we went, but it was a learning experience for us both.\n",
      "I left this restaurant feeling horrible. We came here hoping for some Korean food, tradition dishes. Sure they were traditional but they tasted horrible. we ordered a variety too. the soontobu was horrible. the fried rice, the dolsot bibimbap and regular bibimbap. there were only two good side dishes. it was just overall really bad. it also gave my aunt some bad trips to the restroom. horrible never again\n",
      "Do not eat hear!! Serving is horrible!!\r\n",
      "Do not waste your money!!\r\n",
      "This is not a good korean restaurant.\r\n",
      "Go to other korean restaurants.\n",
      "Owner has very bad attitude. Fried chicken is ok but the oyster and pork pancake is horrible. Full of green onions and onions inside the pancake. Taste very bad. After we said the food is not we expected, owner does not take customer's opinion and said their food is the way it is in a very unpleasant way. I will never come back again.\n",
      "The service was terrible, we came into the restaurant, and looking at the menu for 5 mins, no water was severed. I asked the manager for water, and I was been told the water will be severed after we ordered?! I asked for the water again, the guy gave me the same answer. Most ridiculous service ever had!  \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Despite of the service, fried chicken wing and fried chicken was fine. The roasted chicken wing was horrible, it was cold inside! Have to ask to recook it! The seafood egg soup was great!\n",
      "Interior of restaurant was very pleasant \r\n",
      "I ordered four dishes - mando, jaegban jjajang, gochu japchae, yangjangpi \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mando - pork and chives inside it was good but portion was small\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Jaegban jjajang - not good. No taste at all. Noodle it self was horrible \r\n",
      "Gochu japchae - not much meat just full of onions and bell pepper also sauce was too sweet\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Yang jang pi- it was ok fresh ingredient but sauce was too sweet i feel like they use honey mustard for the sauce \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "three stars for the service and environment. I will not go back.  if they cannot make good jjajang noodle its failure  for Chinese korean restaurant\n",
      "Last time I was here I had horrible service and couple months I crave for black noodles and the service was good, our food was faster than the last time and service was better will come back again.\n",
      "Server was slow, place was not even busy, food took long, water was not refilled, the steam bun was really hard and chewy, been here a couple of times and was disappointed with this last visit, will not be coming here again if service continues to be horrible.\n",
      "We were in here on 4th July night, expecting busy night since it was on a holiday. As I expected, it was busy, and there was only one server and a busser working. In my opinion, it was a horrible decision as of their service. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We had all you can eat for $29, which was decent for korean BBQ. But as the night went on, it was not worth $29. First time the server came and served us quickly with food, but then as we were eating things were running out such as water, napkin, meat, rice, and side dishes. We asked for all those things, and in return, we got what we wanted after 15-25 mins. I mean I asked for refill on the water and napkin for four times. FOUR DIFFERENT TIMES!!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As a hungry/paid customer, I wanted to eat but the server wasn't attentive. It made me not want to eat anymore. after all it was all you can eat right?. if they can serve the food, I don't think it will consider as all you can eat. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Food was okay, wasn't anything special. It was just korean BBQ\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At the end of the night, I got the check, and 18% gratuity was on there. In the menu clearly states that if more than 6 people are seated, they will charge gratuity. But it was just two people, and they charged tips on there and didn't say anything to us. I was shocked. I'm not saying this because I'm cheap, they didn't do a job that was worth 18% \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Would I be going back? Of course not. Food is important, but service is as important when it comes to restaurant.\n",
      "I don't write reviews often. But this time, it's the worst experience. Therefore, I have to split it out. This's the worst Korean food I ever ate. It tasted horrible. And the service was terrible. Since we sat down, there was no one took care of us. Anyway, it's not worth the money.\n",
      "This is a decent representation of Korean Style BBQ, not great, but not horrible either. Hangul is the primary language here so be prepared for some communication issues.\r\n",
      "Luckily my wife is Korean, so that presents no problem for us.\r\n",
      "The food is tasty and adequate, but not mind blowing or great. It is pricey but you are on the strip.\r\n",
      "The side dishes are adequate and plentiful, and there is a nice selection of Korean and Japanese Beers to compliment the meal. IMHO this place is good if you just need a Korean BBQ Fix, but it isn't going to wow a seasoned KBBQ Eater.\r\n",
      "I prefer Kimchi at the other end of the Strip, but if I'm in the area and craving KBBQ, I will stop here and partake of their offerings.\r\n",
      "Overall this would not be a bad dinner choice for most people just looking for a different experience. True KBBQ Fans however will most likely be unimpressed.\n",
      "First of all, this is place is oddly placed behind a Walgreens store right off the strip and we didn't even plan on coming here. It just so happened I ran into it since me and my family were at Walgreens. It was appealing to me because I had not seen any other Korean BBQ spot around town so we decided to stop in for some dinner. THE PRICES HERE WERE RIDICULOUS! i mean ouch, $35 something for a small plate of bulgogi..!!! but besides the location and price being horrible, the food was decent and they served us some delicious sides. I definitely wouldn't come back here tho since you could hit the vegas buffets for much less $$$.\n",
      "Horrible service \r\n",
      "I called and I spoke with a lady around 11:15 and I asked how much is it per person and she told me $26 or 29 it depend on how many items I want or something like that \r\n",
      "So I drove to here and after I was seated I informed the server I want the 26 per person deal \r\n",
      "And said that's only a lunch special I told her I just Spoke with you les than hour ago and she said that's what we have \r\n",
      "It's not about the $3 just the whole situation made me feel uncomfortable \r\n",
      "Check who answered the phone wed 24th around 11 because they are misinforming the customer and the waitress who has a horrible attitude at 12:37 am\n",
      "DO NOT COME HERE. Don't do it. It sounds intriguing late at night but it's not worth the terrible service, horrible food, and overall bad quality. Not to mention you're gambling on getting food poisoning within 2-3 hours max. Literally, the worst kbbq experience I've ever had. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nobody speaks English.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "You get every kind of meat on the menu even if you don't like it and you're still forced to eat it or you'll get charged.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Everyone is unbelievably rude.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "You will literally regret your decision coming here almost immediately. I was one second away from complaining to a manager and calling the health inspector. The only thing stopping me from speaking to a manager was the fact that I know they don't speak English. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "AND THEN THEY TRIED TO OVERCHARGE US. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "If I could leave negative stars I would.\n",
      "About a week ago, my family of four visited Vegas for the Christmas and we had great time and great food in the city except this one.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was dinner time and they were not busy. After being seated for 20min, try finally took our order which was all you can eat bbq. The All-you-can-eat has an hour time limit and they started serving our food in about 20min without asking what dishes we wanted. Besides, we ordered appetizers separately, they finally served the appetizers when we were almost done with the meal (we had rushed them serval times so we got our food). During the meal they served food very slowly and never checked up on us. We did not really enjoy the meal because we had to rush for food and water, and we did not get service from them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The most impressive thing happened. We paid by cash with 13% tip.  (I know that I should have paid 15% for dinner, but they did not give us service so I think it is reasonable to pay less) They stopped us from leaving because we did not pay 18% tip. The lady explained that there is 18% gratuity with party of 6 or more. And our table is for 6 people, so we must pay 18% tip. I told them that we did not choose our table and there were only four of us so the gratuity rule did not apply on us. We were not happy about their service so I put down the amount I thought they deserved. Then she started being mad, gave us an attitude and said something angrily in her language. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I think it was just a very horrible experience in a trip and I will not recommend friends to come because of the awful service.\n",
      "EXPENSIVE. Two pieces of Korean BBQ for $28+? Are you kidding me? \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Regardless, food was delicious. The chicken and Korean BBQ were flavorful. The little side dishes were also really good. The salad was my favorite. It was light and refreshing. The dressing on it was delicious. Tofu soup was okay. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Service was horrible. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I'd probably eat here again because it's convenient and the food is good.\n",
      "Food is horrible! We ordered all u can eat, beef is not fresh, it doesn't even looks like beef because of the color, we didn't have a bite. Can't give a word on it.\n",
      "It was... Ok. I have had outstanding Korean BBQ  but this was not the case here. At first it is impressive with all of the pickled condiments they bring out. Meat is seasoned well. But the grill was pretty tiny for a group of 6. Took too long to cook everything. Partially because the girl kept coming around and turning down our heat. They didn't want us to have anything nicely seared... Just that awkward grey color. We also opted for the all you can eat for $30 per person. What they meant was all they wanted us to eat. We wanted more short ribs and were told we already exceeded our limit? Huh? We were only allowed 2 scrawny pieces a person. My bad... I was busy cooking for the rest of the group... Guess I missed out on my two pieces. Now that I think about it, I think that they were turning down our heat so we would eat slower. Then my friends wanted dessert. They don't have dessert. Sigh... Not horrible however so many amazing places I'm not in a hurry to go back.\n",
      "My friends and I were in Vegas for EDC '19 and this was walking distance from the Marriott we stayed at. For an All You Can Eat buffet, their menu only offered 5-6 items if I remember correctly for $29/person. I would say it was worth for the amount of food but the other 5 friends I was with said it wasn't. Their portions are HUGE compared to the AYCE buffets I've been to in Houston and they limit you 1.5 hours to order and eat and then you're cut off after that. We ended up only ordering 1 round since that was all our stomachs could handle. The quality of the meats were pretty good along with the marinade for an AYCE. Don't really have any complaints besides the amount they brought out all at once. It was kind of intimidating especially if they've made it clear that you're going to be charged extra for not finishing what you've ordered. \r\n",
      "A little upset thinking back that I could've gotten more with the $30 if we had eaten somewhere else . . \r\n",
      "If half stars were possible, I'd give it 3.5 !! It wasn't a horrible experience but I would've just wished I felt like I ate my $30 worth.\n",
      "I am biting my tongue giving this one star rt now!! It's only because the food is great but the service here is horrible.....we walked into a packed restaurant and no one greeted us. People before us told us they were told to just sit and wait.....we waited it out a few tables got cleaned and we just sat our selves.....was then told that it will be a wait on our food. We stuck it out but as we looked around a few people actually just got up and walked out and said they sat waiting over an hr. One server to the whole place and she looks miserable,  no sense of urgency or anything.....I have to say that this place has great food but they need to speed up the service your in Chinatown in the central location for tourist and locals to eat and your service blows.....I don't know how they will last....good luck mr. Tofu.....\n",
      "Horrible service after 40 minutes our soups came out with rice from a different restaurant and our order of galbi never came didn't even eat because everything was just horrible.\n",
      "ordered omurice and rice roll. Everything is mediocre. Not horrible, not amazing, the kind of thing you can do at home. The side dishes are disappointing, I will say below the average of Korea town.\r\n",
      "The service is nice though.\n",
      "This is my favorite korean restaurant - I would give it a 5 but the service is horrible. I've been here more than 15 times and each time we have to ask multiple times for things like hot sauce, more tea, more appetizers because the first waitress would forget/ignore our order - even at non busy times like 4.30pm. \r\n",
      "The food is delicious though and good price for it. The appetizers are a good selection and it is really nice of them to give us refills.\r\n",
      "I've had mostly the bbq, spicy beef stew & bimbambap and never been disappointed with my choice and never had friends complain about their order. \r\n",
      "If you get there between 6.30-7.30pm - there is always a wait so be prepared to wait... but well worth the wait and the line moves fast!\n",
      "This place is really good! I come here at least twice a month, every time time I come here I get the kimchi jjigae. Altogether this place is pretty inexpensive. Service isn't amazing but isn't horrible, waitresses are fluent in Korean and Mandarin! 1 or 2 of the waitresses are fluent in English the rest have a basic understanding. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "OVERALL HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE FOOD IS REALLY GOOD!\n",
      "My meal looks like something I threw together in a rush at home. The meal wasn't even hot and the service is horrible. Very disappointing.\n",
      "This used to be at least a 4 1/2 star for me, every time I was in the area I'd convince family/friends to meet me here! introduced quite a few Korean food newbies lol Their service was great and GamJaTang was really really yummy and good portions.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "BUT recently the few times i went the GanJaTang was horrible (one time was to introduce two friends to it, I was embarrassed) Gunky, and tasteless and there was maybe 3-4 pieces of small bones. The service was definitely not as good as before (I wonder if they changed cooks or owners)\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "FINALLY, the last time that made me decide- :( to never go back- was for my brother's 27th birthday, there was 9 of us and they put us at the biggest table, in a semi private enclosure. This would have been fine because they had a bell we can ring for service, except the servers seems to have a knack for ignoring it. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It took us so long for us to wave down the server each time to:\r\n",
      "1. order\r\n",

      "3. ask for more gas in our canister\r\n",
      "4. remind her of the fact we are still waiting for new gas canisters (while raw meat is half cooked on the grill) which was suppose to be table cooking style but because she was so busy, she dumped the whole plate of meat on the table grill and left it sitting there before we realize they started cooking but wanted us to finish cooking. I had to stand up and stare her down outside our room so she would remember that we were still here waiting for our food. At which point she still took 2 other tables orders and served one table before coming back to us??? It would have took her 1 minute to refill it in the first place when she removed the other one and we could have been eating for that 15 minutes while she forgot.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "She was never rude at any point but the carelessness is what made me even more upset, everyone at the table was starving and trying to make the best of it and it just got worse and worse. got to the point where we were pressing the bell continuously for 2 minutes and nothing! \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So I'm sad that one of my favorite staples in Young and Finch is no longer on my go-to list, but hopefully if they revamp the service and food in the future I can come back with an empty stomach ready to chow!\r\n",

      "Oh goodness.. what a terrible experience. I wanted to go to Hashi Izakaya, which is just a couple doors down from this place, but majority ruled that we go here for dinner. Got seated as soon as we walked in.. alright, so far so good. Spent some time deliberating over what to order. When we had decided, they took FOREVER to come by and take our order, despite us ringing our call button every couple minutes. They only bring you your sides after you order, so those eventually arrived afterwards. The sides were the standard kinds you usually get at Korean places, about average quality. They give you disposable paper place mats to eat your meals on at this place, so while the four of us were waiting for our meals, we started using the back of one to play Pictionary. When a waitress arrived with two of the four entrees we ordered, she already had a disgruntled, sour look on her face. Either she was in a really bad mood or she hates her job. Maybe both. She just started arbitrarily all-but-flinging the plates on the table, mumbling the names and not even bothering to figure out who they belonged to. The two dishes she brought first were mine and the girl sitting across from me, us being seated furthest away from her. Of the two people sitting facing each other closest to her, one was missing her place mat (we were using it for Pictionary) and the other had it in his hands (he was drawing on it). The waitress paused and stared at what he was doing, then in the biggest display of passive aggressive attitude ever, yanks his own place mat from under his elbows and places it in front of the other girl who was missing hers. Okay. I would understand her behaviour if she was trying to serve my friend her meal and wanted to ensure there was something under the dish. But no. She didn't have anything else to serve us and just stormed off. The other two dishes didn't show up for another five (the guy's meal) and then ten (the girl with the missing place mat's meal) minutes. So.. what the heck was the point of all that? The food itself was horrible, too. Maybe I just ordered a bad dish.. I can't be sure. I ordered the dak kalbi jungsik (marinated and BBQ'd spicy chicken on hot plate with rice). The dish was mostly onions, with a few pieces of chicken that were mostly gristle, connective tissue and cartilage. Horrible. It wasn't even a decent sized portion for $12. When we finished our meals, it also took forever and a day to get our bill. I think the fact that we were sitting in a booth didn't help because they just seemed to forget about us, but the call button on the table should mitigate that fact.. Whatever. I'm not coming back here unless I get dragged and the meal's free. Waste of time and money in an area overflowing with better options. Don't bother.\n",
      "The food is bland but worst of all the service is horrible. Anyways you get what you pay for. But I have had much better Korean food in other restaurants for the same price. Won't ever visit this place again.\n",
      "This place had the worst service I've ever experienced at a Korean bbq place. We never got our appetizers and the Entrees took forever to come out. Our water also never go refilled and we were only able to order dishes at a time even though our party fit 2 tables. We decided to just get up and leave after ordering just a few dishes. I would suggest to go somewhere else. The food is mediocre and the price is so expensive. On top of everything, gratuity was included in our bill even though the service was horrible.\n",
      "I was so excited when I heard they have Boba!! But I'm so disappointed with their boba drinks.. I purchased 2 different drinks and they taste horrible.. (taro and milk tea) Customer service was great, unfortunately I'm never purchasing their boba again. \r\n",

      "I came here the other night for yuk gae jang. I had it when I was in Korea, and I was craving it. I read reviews and read that it had a really good one. My friend ordered the sulletang, and he liked it. My yuk gae jang was pretty great. There was egg, shredded beef, some weird string thing, a thin rice noodles. The soup I had in Korea had more beef in it, but the soup broth was nice and spicy and tasted pretty good. I really enjoyed it. The other dishes we ordered were a fried chicken and omurice. The fried chicken was a little dry, and I don't think I really like the omurice. Those things are just personal preference, though. The omurice doesn't taste horrible, it's just not something I would go there to order. \r\n",

      "I do like the water that they serve- it's barley water which is a refreshing change to water. It's called a barstaurant so there are alcoholic beverages which I don't drink. After 11, you do have to be 21 in order to go to the restaurant.\n",
      "Please if u are not korean, or dont look korean, avoid this place! U will get 3rd class treatment. Service was horrible but the people next to me got it made like vip. We waited at our table for 35 mins on this 1 bottle of tea, and never came back. We walked up outta there after yelping another korean restaurant. I repeat, NON KOREANS, avoid this one.\n",
      "This place has ok food but horrible customer service. We've eaten here before and we knew the wait for the food was long but this time was so bad we walked out. When we got there no one greeted us. Then when they called our name to be seated he started talking to another couple that just got there and sat them at the bar. My husband had to ask if that empty table was ours then we sat ourselves. We sat there for 10 mins and watch waiters and waitresses pass us by. We waited another 10 mins and by then no one acknowledge we were there. So we walked out and are heading to a more authentic Korean restaurant. I guess if your not Korean they won't serve you well. I don't think we will be going there again.\n",

      "We had 7 adults and 1 child in our group. They told us that they didn't have a big enough table for us to sit together now so if we want we can wait for 30-40 min or sit at separate tables. Then we sat down at two tables. During the meal, the service was beyond horrible. The food was average.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When we asked for the check, there was a 20% tip added onto our bill. They explained the charge was for large group more than 6 people. Well, we didn't seat together so we asked to have separate check for each table. Then they still charged the 20% tip on each check. We asked to take the tip off of the bill since we only have 4 people each table and we'd like to decide on the amount of tips. They tried to argue that we had 8 people in our group no matter what. In the end, they reprinted the checks again. This time, we were charged $3 for the appetizer dishes on one of the bills because accordingly what we ordered was not supposed to have complementary appetizers. Excuse me!? First of all, if that was the case, we never asked for the appetizers. They were served with our dishes. Second, it's not stated on the menu and we were not warned.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We asked to speak with the owner because the charges were just unreasonable and the reasons they gave were ridiculous. They told us that the owner was not there and refused to revise the bills again. In the end, we didn't have the time to sit there and wait for a police to come in. We still paid for the meal with no tip.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We understand that the waitresses were really busy and didn't have a chance to give better service. We originally wanted to give 10% tip but it turned out to be such a joke.\r\n",

      "We will never come again.\n",
      "Been here a few times now. Food is good. Prices are reasonable. But service is consistently horrible. This may be due to being understaffed but it's unacceptable. You won't see your waiter very often. Sometimes not for the entire duration of your meal after he brings your food. Might have to go up to the counter to ask for your check since they often just completely forget about you.\n",
      "Came here with a party of 5 plus a toddler.... staff tried to stuff is all into a booth...when we asked to sit at the tables (b/c the joint was empty) staff was RUDE!!!!! They set us up on one table ... which then defeated the request to sit at the table ..... \r\n",

      "corn. Mandoo was good nothing spectacular and corn was just corn off the cob with mozzarella cheese baked on top. Also ordered Kalbi and soft tofu soup with seafood. The Kalbi was a little tough and the soup was a little oily and the few pieces of tiny clams in it were all closed! Not horrible but not worth a second visit. Did like the booths though felt nice and private.\n",

Lots of employees in restaraunt but everyone is scared to greet people because of the crowd... Total frikin garbage!!! Guys coming in tipping host to get a table!!!! Wtf!!! Asked to sit at crappy ass 3 person bar to get a quick fix & host came by after 20 mins and asked what do u want!!! What do I want? I want u to wipe down this shit ass bar so my wife & I can get a drink u worthless service lacking & absolutely disgusting back bar with nasty ass old match box cars covered in some kind of jizz ... Really ? Walked right out pissed off at the atrocity of service and disgusting cleanliness of this joint... Read so many good reviews of the food but by how it looked behind the bar I would never even feed my dog there.... So sad by how this business is run... Can't give 0 stars if I could..... Total crap experience for a place right next to our house... Horrifyingly horribleness ... I can always give a place a second chance but not this one Fail... Fail... Fail... Food might be good but I never ever want to know .... Grade 0 stars F-\n",
      "Good food overall. But the service was terrible. Our server was super rude although the food was delicious. Problems with our server in regards to attitude was very distasteful. But the ambience of the place is very nice and homey. The garlic sauce chicken wings was wonderful. I had the jap char with bulgogi as well which was really good. Not too salty. But the horrible service put a bit of a taint on the first dining experience. Server was very slow on checking on us and refilling waters and the place wasn't even packed or busy. A bit of a disappointment.\n",
      "This place is honestly a 3.5 but too bad they don't have that option. The place itself is super cute and very appealing to a younger crowd. The service was average...not great but not horrible. Umm, the side dishes definitely need A LOT of work...it tasted horrible lol. (And I'm Korean..so I have some expectations when it comes to Korean side dishes) The food itself was average as well. Not the best thing I've ever had, but it does the job. I think this place is more suitable for the night time for drinks...it's basically a Korean pub/bar.\n",
      "Went for my daughters bday she wanted Korean food. My wife is half Korean and we thought it would be semi authentic, but what we got was nothing like what we are used to having. We ordered beef Bulgogi, spicy pork Bulgogi, and the Korean ribs. The ribs were the best thing we ate, but I had to wait an hour for the burnt taste of the pork Bulgogi to leave my mouth. The beef Bulgogi was OK but not authentic at all. Service was horrible and I had to wait more than ten minutes from ordering a drink to get one, and they are not worth the price. If you are looking for good Korean food or service go elsewhere. Also I think the server forgot to put in my daughters food, because it came out 15 minutes after the rest of the meal.\n",

      "A key ingredient to great service is your glass of water.  A waiter who seamlessly keeps your glass full, like an endless well, is a great waiter because they are taking care of such a simple detail, and allowing you to focus your time on conversation or enjoying the food.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "However, for us, after the initial serving of bottles (self serve your own glasses) the bottles were never really replenished even after we requested it.  So first fail.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The second came at the serving of food.  I can say that my food was good, but it was, IMHO, a simple dish...curried chicken and rice. And for me it was a great meal at a decent price.\r\n",

      "But! ( you knew there was one!)  My friend ordered some crazy pig bone soup dish....I can't remember it nut it was intense and overflowing...so much that they spilt it all over him...hot soup...(thank god we were in our beach gear still...not really but I'm trying to be glass half full here).  \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "While they didn't offer any additions or reductions in cost they also didn't up their service for my friend.  Poor guy didn't get his utensils, they wouldn't bring him more water or tea...it seemed like they were purposely ruining his night.  \r\n",
      "\r\n",

The sauce was fairly generic, not very spicy (2 stars). The bibim bap (~16) is perfectly eatable (that's the 3 stars), but that dish is more comfort food than anything else. Surely not worth the price.\r\n",

The soup base for the Pork Bone was there.. and it was flavourful, but it was missing a bit of thickness to it, in other words, it was runny.. I believe it's because they didn't summer long enough or with the right package of ingredients. \r\n",

We agreed  this other rude man said to order on the counter but the way he said it and went about it was so demanding. He reminded me of a C.O in prison... We didn't even sit down and eat because customer service was so horrible. With that said.... Screw Komex fusion and all it's rudeass employees!\n",

I politely chimed in that I was trying the place for the first on a very high recommendation of a friend and asked what they would suggest for my first time.  Apparently they didn't care much that they were recommended as I was abruptly told it was a Mexican restaurant served with Korean meats...yeah, I kind of knew that...then recommended I have what my friend had..Idk what they had, and was pretty turned off at that point...so yeah, long story short, wasn't worth the money paid, but it wasn't horrible...and if you're going to check it out for yourself, definitely look at the menu ahead of time and have an idea of what you want to order before going in.\n",

      "Linda, you need to fire Kenny what a horrible attitude. First I came in and noticed the sign mentioning you are not fast food. Which I have understood for years, Kenny commented how people still complain and they need to learn to call in their order and stop complaining. Then I brought my order home, calling it in about an hour before picking it up.  I had ordered the bulgogi rolls, usually 6 per order, kenny had never heard of them and had to ask the kitchen about them.  When I checked the order at home there were only 4 rolls and I had made a double order.  When I called Kenny got an attitude with me stating they don't really make them anymore and they won't again because you have franchised out.  He messed up another part of the order and really didn't care.  After eating here since you opened I hope your service doesn't go down hill just because you are opening another place....be careful.\n",
      "I ate here a while ago and it was the first thing my friend and I ate after a day in Red Rock and as soon as it hit our stomachs we knew we were in for some horrible food poisoning. I kid you not, I went to the bathroom to throw up in the middle of the meal because my stomach hurt so bad. I have never gone back and as much as I love the idea and concept of this place, I do not want to have to worry about shitting my pants everytime I eat a bulgogi burrito.\n",

If you just want decent Korean food, then I would recommend but if you want good service, go to Owl right down the street. They do have a big variety of side dishes though which I enjoyed. I would come back but it's not my go to Korean restaurant.\n",
      "Went there with my friend. The food was okay. Obviously Korean food and price at Yonge and finch are better. The staff were pretty rude. They kept ignoring me and my friend and while my friend was paying, the old staff lady stood infront of our table, glared at my friend and yelled at her to pay 10% tips. To be fair, tipping is fine but their service was horrible. Not gonna go there again!\n",
      "I ordered a beef noodle soup here and was greatly let down. There were a few pieces of disgustingly old beef and the noodles were over-cooked to the point of falling apart with a single touch. Not to mention, the broth was obviously prepared from a great amount of chicken broth and laden with MSG as I was super thirsty after. The banchan was horrible and inauthentically prepared - it lacked depth and there was no aroma of sesame oil. The saving grace of this review was my mom's gamjatang, which came with 4 to 5 pork bones, filled to the brim (not pictured). She loved and praised it a lot!\n",
      "This place f-ing sucks balls! As soon as you walk in this place it reeks of mildew dirty water!! The floor plan is horrible, the food server is forgetful and is overwhelmed with work. Whatever you do don't eat here I could've had a V8! I had the bulgoli cheesesteak with fries and it had no flavor whatsoever! Fuck this place!!!\n",

OK SO TMI, anyways...\r\n",

      "The space is big... lots of cooktop tables.  That also means lots of smoke and grease in the air.  The owners need to turn up the exhaust fans or something.  They need better ventilation pronto. Plenty of meats and apps to choose from off the menu, but the quality of meat wasn't great.  Everything was too sweet... too much sauce or marinade... really mediocre cuts.  \r\n",

      "GEN! I loved going to Gen when they were still in SoCal. They used to have unmarinated short ribs and it was so delicious. Then they switched suppliers and they no longer carried the unmarinated short ribs so I stopped going as much. Then they came to Vegas but they were in Henderson and that was far. But they are pretty much the cheapest AYCE BBQ in Vegas at $21.99 per person. And now that they have opened up on Decatur and Sahara, they are much closer and maybe we can go more often!\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "We ordered a bunch of their beef tongue and beef belly. They were really delicious. Just be sure not to overcook them or the meat will get tough. We also got their pork belly, brisket, steak, hawaiian, steak, bulgogi, japchae, and some other things. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Everything was pretty good. Meat was decent. The japchae was so-so .. I've had better japchae at other places. It's still nice to have though so you won't be eating meat the whole time. There's salad as well. Unfortunately, they don't have the rice paper side dish yet since they are in soft opening. Though, honestly, I wouldn't count them having it all the time regardless of soft opening or grand opening cause their Henderson location doesn't always have it. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Service was pretty good. They didn't have a limit on how much you can order, which is fantastic. They used to limit you to four a few years back but now they don't! The meats got delivered super fast but who knows if that'll stay that way. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They were actually supposed to open earlier. They were working on getting some disposable grill plates for the grills since they are really hard to clean. They figured that it may be easier for them to just dispose it after it's been used. However, the problem with disposable grills is that it causes a lot of smoke when you use it. And because of that, they couldn't pass the health department with it. In the end, they had to scrap that idea and go along with the traditional grills. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "If Gen could get the adjustable hoods like the ones in Korea or the ones at Hobak and Doh, it would be so much better. Even though the establishment is brand new, their ventilation is horrible. Normally, a place takes a while for it to stink up with BBQ smell but I walked out smelling like some grilled short ribs and keep in mind that they are still in soft opening!\n",
      "Best service i have ever had at a Gen BBQ chain. I been to all the ones in Nor Cal...  Stuck up asians were horrible and service was horrendous especially at the Milpitas branch. I understand they were understaffed but the staff were full of crap to begin with. Sahara was very attentive to our table and knew what we needed.\n",
      "We use to love this place when they first opened.  But as time goes on they seem to get worse and worse.  The service and management is horrible.  Service is getting slower and slower.  After we finished the first of the salad we asked for more and they said they were out.  If we would have known that we would have left and ate somewhere else.   We eat our meat with the salad instead of rice and everything else that gets you full.  To eat the meat plain was horrible.  Very disappointing.  We had to wait 20 minutes to get a glass of water after sitting down.  After talking to the manager he didn't seem to care.\n",
      "I just have to give 5 Stars to this all you can eat Korean BBQ. First we have been here at least 1 time a week. Everytime is such a pleasure and the mood and staff are GREAT! But I am serious about this and the food is very good and the price is right. You get so much for your money here. For those that have been here knows exactly what I say is true. Honestly, my wife and I enjoy this place alot. It's all you can eat and they are so helpful and friendly. Unlike our horrible time at 8oz. On my wife's Birthday. 8oz doesn't come close to this place. The mood at Gen is nice and cozy. The booths are soft and very comfortable, and the music is just loud enough to enjoy and not have to talk over it. We highly --- And I do speak highly of this place. We will again be going on Friday and believe it or not. We can't wait to enjoy their short ribs.  Thank you Gen for giving our city a nice place to eat at a great price.\n",
      "So I didn't even get to enjoy my dinner with my friends and family because the service here was horrible. The host pops an attitude to my cousin who just asked not to be seated yet because not all of our party was there yet. Then our server who's name was #prince by the way who kept giving my sister an attitude because she went to ask to speak to a manager because he won't stop with the eye rolling or slamming plates down or even when she just ask if the corn can be charged separately from the all you can eat price. Because my niece doesn't eat meat. Mind you everyone at our table are all managers in the food and beverage industry. Even us as managers understand it's a Saturday night, it gets busy we understand. The only people who was nice and gave us good service was the busy boys and the other server #jan. I visited the Cerritos, California location and I got really great service on a busy Friday night. I won't be coming back to this location ever again.\n",
      "Disappointed. This used to be one of my favorite KBBQ places.  My recent experience was horrible.  I called and they said it's a 15 minute wait, I arrive 20 seconds later and they now say it's a 20 minute wait.  There were many empty tables around the restaurant and still many people waiting. We ended up waiting 30 minutes and got sat, after me asking what's taking so long because there were so many empty tables.  The shrimp and calamari and the octopus tasted and smelled like chlorine, I kid you not.  The mushrooms and veggies had no mushrooms.  The chicken had an inedible taste. Some of my beef orders were alright but not great. Water tasted and smelled like chlorine as well.  I also had to flag down our waitress every time. She wasn't coming to see if we wanted anything else or if we were OK, so I always had to either ask for her or flag her down.  Horrible experience.\n",
      "We got horrible service! My whole table we all work in the industry from servers to managers! Let's start off the night so we came we had a reservation but only 3/4 of our party was here so we told the hostess to just sit others 1st we will wait but they kept trying to hurry us! But their rules are once you sat your 2 hours starts! Once again that's why we said let others go before us! So finally we sat! Server comes over....no greet no nothing...just what do you want to drink? Ok I guess its Saturday night it busy! Ok fine...when it came to ordering so my daughter is vegetarian wanted just the cheese corn! So I asked our server...do u have a la carte or can I just order just ayce corn only bc that's literally all she wants! He says no (no explanation, just a blunt NO) He said he will charge me still for the corn and her 2 bites of salad? Because we technically haven't order yet just our drinks! So I said that's fine dont worry about it I'll leave so you dont think im going to try to eat! (With a attitude) he tells me 'well ima charge you still' we both (my daughter and I) just had few bites of salad! I asked him is he serious he said yes...continues to argue and popping a attitude! At this point I'm irritated so I asked a manager! Rolls his eyes and walked off. Manager comes over at 1st she had a attitude too. But calm down after I apologize for having issues! After a few times of her telling me that she will charge me $5 for the corn everytime I order (which I got it, the 1st time) after this when the server comes back like 10 mins with 1 of my guest asking him to come over to get my order btw! I also apologize to him bc i didn't want to make a big deal! Once again just gave me a attitude instead! So onto dinner! My friend is drinking her strawberry lemonade when she happens to look at her cup (the cup is clear btw) it had lipstick all over it! So she got grossed out and ask for a water not charged for it! Server came back slams her water down as shes asking about it being on her check! He snaps back ITS ALREADY DONE! Not necessary! When we asked for forks...he said WE DONT HAVE FORKS! Overall we kept getting our plates slammed  attitude left and right! His name was Prince! We found out thru his nametag! He had another server come finish us off! He didnt even come get payment! His partner Jan and the foodrunners were better! Manager she was Ok Jan and foodrunners were great! Server Prince horrible! I will never come back! No recommendations for this location!!! Work on your attitudes! Dont like your job peace out! I understand it's a busy night but learn customer service skills under stress! I dont think Gen is going to even care about this post but I just want to let the city know! Good food but horrible service!!!\n",

The kimchi stole the show and was by far the best item I had. My veggie and beef soup was just okay.  Maybe I should have gotten something else.  Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad... but it wasn't great.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The service was about a 3.  The woman was actually friendly in a stand offish kind of way.  With all of this said, this is the best Korean place I have been to so far in Vegas-- this is no K-town in LA or even Buena Park in OC.  That much is certain.\n",

      "This place was something that my friend and I originally overlooked - we really wanted Korean BBQ (at 10pm, I know....), but we decided to come in and ask how late the place was open to look at our options. We made it in time for last call and the server actually convinced us to stay, even though there was no BBQ. We thought some Korean food at the end of the night would still suffice. We left absolutely happy and completely satisfied with our meal and experience.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "First off, the atmosphere of the restaurant was actually very casual yet friendly. It was a medium sized restaurant that also had private areas to them. We were seated by the window and I still felt like we had a great deal of privacy at the same time.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The price of the food was not too horrible either - a decent price for the quality of the food we bought. Forgive me if I spell anything wrong, but my friend and I split a small hot sake, bulgogi bibimbap, L.A. ribs, and two sweet drinks: Ginger and rice (I believe?) and a cinnamon one,  which I had never tried before. With our meal we get delicious side dishes as well as miso soup, which was excellent. Overall, we spent about $60 which was not too horrible for us - of course, we did split the food. The overall taste of the food was absolutely delicious and pretty high up there in favorites of Korean restaurants, even with NY Korea Town places.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Although, the main reason why I absolutely had one of the best experiences here was the service I was given. As soon as we walked in, the server convinced us to stay even though it was last call. I hate coming in for last call because I don't like to inconvenience the workers, but he made us feel right at ease and we decided to stay. My friend and I like to joke around and poke fun at each other and the server played right into our antics and immediately felt like a friend. It was not something that felt forced - it felt absolutely genuine. The other ladies there were all absolutely pleasant and made sure that we were always comfortable, that we were having a good time, and always had a smile on their faces. I am absolutely used to being rushed out of a place, or given such fake smiles and demeanors. This service was absolutely refreshing and it really did feel like a place full of friends.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I do have to give a shout out to our server, Tyler, for being such an absolute sport with EVERYTHING that we said and did. He rolled with the punches, gave wonderful recommendations, and helped us when one of us could not figure out how to use the machine  for our cards. He made us feel so welcomed and we felt like we left at our own pace - he treats the customers like people he wants to truly get to know. I would absolutely go back there just for the wonderful service again. No hesitation.\n",
      "I came here on a weekend and it was pretty busy. There's not many Korean restaurants around Yonge and Dundas so I can see why this could be the only option for Korean food if you are near. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Service: I was seated immediately but no one gave us menus or offered water. My party was neglected until we got up ourselves to get the menu from the counter. My first impression is that they don't have an efficient system to make sure all customers are serviced soon upon seating. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Food:\r\n",
      "Pork bibimbap: this was okay. The pork was thinly sliced and it lack flavor. I ended up not eating a lot because it was just mostly fat. The bibimbap is okay. You can't really go wrong with bibimbap since it's just a bunch of stuff mixed together. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Seafood pancake: this was mediocre. It has too much dough. It is also really overpriced. It was $16 for a pancake while many other restaurants is around $10.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Galbi beef: the portion was extremely small for the price. It felt like a side dish rather than a main entree for $16. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Overall the food was okay. Service was horrible. But definitely overpriced Korean food. I would rather not eat Korean food in this area ever again or I'll take the initiative to venture out to ktown for cheaper and better tasting Korean food.\n",
      "The food there is not bad. But their service is horrible. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When I finished it, they cleared my table immediately and asked me to pay it. They didn't even let me take a rest there. And then I ordered something else and wanted to have it there. But they just wrapped it and expected me to leave immediately. \r\n",

      "I had been to Kimchi House many years ago and thought it was pretty good. A month or so ago I had a real hankering for Korean but didn't want to drive all the way to Little Korea in the west end or uptown north of Sheppard. I had remembered this place and convinced my wife to head over.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The great news is that this place was better than I had remembered. We actually ordered more than we needed but I'm not a quitter so we beat the table! ;)\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "If you are downtown and in the mood for good Korean food, then this is a fantastic option. It's too bad that they are so close to that horrible hack of a Macha ice cream shop that puts out a terrible radius of failure around it!\n",
      "I came on the night of Boxing Day. The hostess at the front was horrible. She was extremely rude and seriously provided the worst service on earth. She was so rude that customers actually left because of her. We almost left because of her. She almost ruined the whole experience. The waitress was a lot better and actually looked like she didn't want to murder us. The food was decent. I got bibimbap, a Korean pork pancake and chicken yaki udon. I would give this place 5 stars but that horrible hostess lowered it by 2 stars.\n",
      "First off I live in the area and eat out often.  So weekdays it's hard to find a place to eat that is not fast food.  Came to this place we walked in at 8:27pm door says closes at 10pm!!! The minute we walk in hostess says the kitchen closes in 20 mins we said ok we would order as soon as we sit down since it closes at 10pm.  She continues to say are you sure which is ridiculous.  Then another women comes up ands says they close at 9pm!!!  Wow, a new place in town is really horrible at service!  If you don't want to serve people or leave early why not just change your times you are open !??? It was rude and not a way to start business with locals .\n",
      "Only been once but their soon tofu has captured my heart. One of my favourite seafood soon tofu places. Super yummy! Although I prefer the side dishes from Tofu Village this place serves some great ones as well. I find the place a little squished but it's not horrible.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Came with a group of six in the evening and we didn't have to wait long to be seating, can definitely hold a large group. Staff is friendly and the outside and inside of the place look pretty good. Inexpensive and yummy, will definitely return!\n",
      "This place has great food and if this review was based on food alone I would be close to giving it a 5. The place is always packed and their tables are so close together that I was constantly being run into by the servers as they passed by. I also didn't really like the servers butt being in my face every time he went to the tables next to ours. That really ruins the experience for me.  When we wanted to go it took forever to get the server to bring by a takeout container for my girls leftovers. \r\n",
      "That being said I would definitely recommend this place for take out because the food really is amazing but it's horrible for a dine in experience.\n",
      "Horrible restaurant, from service to food. \r\n",
      "I from Montreal and I love Korean food. I always heard about Korean town in Toronto, how it have a lot of authentic foods. I have hype ha e looking for worth to try this restaurant. Their bimbimpap is popular.\r\n",
      "But oh boy !!!! It taste horrible. I order their seafood tofu stew ( I think ) and it taste like waters, literally water with tofu. My friend order a bulgogi (pardon me for my spelling). It is really sweet, too sweet, like a dessert. A plus for it is the volume of meet. It really good for its price. And their rice is off the hook.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "About the service, almost employers are horrible towards my friend and I. We never got a refill water. They didn't even make eye contact with me when I ask about the menu. Their answers are rude and cold. Even the bus boy, he scup our rice and dump it in our bowl. Horrible horrible experience for me. It is not even a rush hour.\r\n",
      "I always take few days after to review a restaurant, to have a fair and real review. It is not worth time to go. \r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "Worst Chimac(Korean Fried Chicken) place I have ever been to. \r\n",
      "Way to salty, greasy, disgusting chicken, horrible service. \r\n",
      "Simply put, It's not a food but pure garbage\n",
      "Let me start off by saying that I've lived in LA for the past 13 years and so I have a very high standard when it comes to Korean food as I believe it's the best in the world (including Korean food in Korea).\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I had low expectations going into this place and I was not disappointed. Don't get me wrong, the service was great. The manager (or owner) went around and greeted the customers and even had a friendly chat with them and would also help serve the food so for that I give them props, but as far as how the food tasted, to me, it's more for non-Koreans (aka white people). I'm not racist (ok maybe a little) but I've noticed the great Korean food spots have little or no non-Koreans and the restaurant looks like shit on the outside and in. The restaurants that have a nicer interior and better service is meant to cater to a different crowd.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So... if you're white, you'll like this place, otherwise, I'd avoid eating Korean food in general in Toronto as I've yet to find one that I enjoyed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Also, parking is absolutely horrible. You will have to pay for parking. Either sell your soul to the devil and find one on the street or pay a few extra dollars to park in a sketchy lot across the street.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Parking: Limited metered street or paid parking lot\r\n",
      "Price: $8-$15 per person\r\n",
      "Wait: 5-10 mins\n",
      "Sorry yelpers, not a fan of this place.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Definitely not the best place for Korean food in Toronto. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Had high hopes for this place based on yelp reviews and was quite disappointed by the outcome.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The service wasn't fantastic as everyone was stating unless I guess u get the owners son who I witness talking to a few tables about his life and such if you're into that sort of thing. We got the other waitress that seemed like she rather be watching Korean dramas then serving tables (but who wouldn't right?) just a small smile would have been nice though. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Anyways we ordered the bulgogi dinner and the pork bone soup which were over priced so I thought they would be exceptional and authentic. Unfortunately they were not that great and definitely not at that price point. The side dishes were horrible and tasted like someone youtubed how to make side dishes and then brought them out to our table.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Overall, I give this place 2 stars. 1 star for the pic with Chow Yun Fat and the owner in the doorway and the other 1 star because the washroom was clean for Koreatown standards.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My search for the best PBS in Toronto continues....\n",
      "This restaurant is terrible. I went twice. The first time was just OK. Plate is dirty, and I let them change one. My friend ordered abalone special porridge, and they came with a wrong one. I order a sweet red bean porridge, but it tastes salty. \r\n",
      "The second time made me angry. My friend and I waited 30mins after we ordered food. We let waiter urge our food, he said he cannot, we should wait or cancel our order. We were hungry, so we choose to wait. Then 5mins later, the waiter came and told us he didn't put our order into system!!! He wasted our 30 mins. We were so hungry but got nothing here. And it seems the waiter didn't feel sorry about his fault.\r\n",
      "If u want to experience the horrible service, this restaurant must be a good choice.\n",
      "Spicy chicken.  That about sums this place up.  I, for one, was not impressed.  It wasn't horrible, but 5 drums set me back 12 bucks before tip.  The atmosphere didn't wow me either.  I'm not so sure this place will beat the curse of their dwelling.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They also win for one of the tiniest men's bathrooms in Charlotte.  You'll hit your head while trying to use the hand dryer, and you should pray no one comes bursting through the bathroom door while you're standing there. If so, you may just get a black eye, if not just full on knocked out.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I cannot speak for anything other than the chicken, but I don't think I'll be back to explore the menu any further.\n",
      "Wings were good other items on sampler platter not so much, stick with the wings. Service on the other hand was horrible. Part of group was done eating before last cood came out. Spend you money elsewhere, wings were good but not worth the poor service.\n",
      "It is a shame that for what is usually a great chain to eat at, that this location is horrible! They don't offer the full menu and they pack a small container of rice, half full. When dining in, the service is super slow. I feel their corporate office needs to reevaluate this location!\n",
      "If I could less than 1 star I would this place sucks! The food is ok but the service from the red head white girl is bs she's rude and service is horrible never checked on us never asked if we needed anything etc , first and last time here\n",
      "Ambience was nice, the view of yonge and finch was nice, the servers were nice. But waffles were overpriced and NOT fresh\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Drinks came out first. It was delicious! The waffles were horrible. I felt like they were not fresh at all. \r\n",
      "His waffle with nuts was basically waffles with icecream and trail mix on top. Stuff that u get from shoppers drug mart which included peanuts, raisins, seeds, cashews, and almonds. \r\n",
      "Mine had fresh kiwi, bananas and maybe fresh strawberries.. The raspberries and blueberries were frozen! And the rest of the fruit they used was from fruit cup. \r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Sorry wouldn't come back here\n",
      "While the cafe itself has a good location and a nice view of Yonge street, I was disappointed by everything else. \r\n",
      "I ordered a coconut slushy bubble tea which tasted like water. The service was horrible. No one came to take my order until I walked up to the counter myself. \r\n",
      "Overall, I was very disappointed with this place and I wouldn't return.\n",
      "I have been here many times and on June 18, 2017 I brought a group of people to this restaurant and it was a horrible experience. First and foremost the restaurant itself was unbearably hot!!!!  And I do mean unbearable!   By the end of the meal it was so disgusting how much sweat was dripping off the eight people at my table. Other customers were complaining as well but my table was all I am concerned about.  This was a celebration meal for us so we went into the restaurant in great moods looking forward to a great meal. 10 minutes later we are all commenting on how warm it is in the restaurant.  10 minutes after that we all agreed it was crazy to have it that hot in there.  So every time everyone wiped their brow or neck with a napkin and left a little white pieces of the napkin all over their face. Sweat was dripping onto the table and into our meals. You couldn't share anything with anyone because your meal had your sweat in it and nobody wanted to touch it.  The second problem with this restaurant was that the food was mediocre at best. We were a table full of Korean natives and this was a sad substitute for Korean food. The restaurant didn't have enough condiments for all of the people inside so our table was robbed of our condiments to give it to somebody else when the meal wasn't halfway \r\n",
      "complete.   I don't understand why they didn't at least open the door to let some fresh air in it was disgusting!  I paid over $275 for this meal, the restaurant was full of patrons so they are making money.   I don't understand why they at least don't have some fans to get some air moving inside. It doesn't have to be air-conditioning it just has to be some air moving. I can't stress enough how disgusting it was wallowing in your own sweat as you're trying to eat a meal. I will never be back.\r\n",
      "P.S.   I emailed the restaurant first to see how they felt about my opinion. There was no response to my email to them or my phone calls. So I felt I was left no choice but to review them on yelp.\n",
      "Food is okay, not so great. Price is just average, could find places that offer better. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "BUT, the service is just horrible. Especially with take-out. I don't have much to complain with when you dine in, but when it comes to take-out, it is just horrible. The place is just impossible to park (right along Yonge). And I usually take out when I just don't have the time to dine in -- I am sure that is what people usually do. But the owners just never care about other people's time. I always phone 10-15 mins before I arrive so that they have the time to pack everything when I drive there for me to pick up right away. And I always double-confirm with them, if they are busy and if I can pick up within 10-15 min. The answer was always certain. BUT the fact is, they always cook or pack the food when I get there. Then for the next 10-15mins you will just see my car in the middle of Yonge Street blinking on its emergency lights. This has happened soo many times, that it once really got on my nerves and I complained about it. They apologized, but did nothing. Next time it was still the same. There was even one time that I chose to walk there, because I knew they would not pack my food until I get there, and I did not want my car to be in the middle of the street for 15 mins. And that time, they made me wait for 20 mins standing there. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One more terrible thing with their take-out service, is the way they pack their stew. I ordered soon tofu stew a few times for take out,. The rice bowl was placed right next to the tall stew jar. When I held up the plastic bags on my way home, the rice bowl would just be squeezed in to the body of tall stew jar. And apparently the food jar was just not strong enough for the pressure and it broke from the middle. Every time I got home, I was left with a plastic bag full of stew, and nothing left in the jar.. .....\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I have been a loyal customer for the past 8 years, and nothing has changed after I complained for so many times. Today, again, despite the fact that I called them for take out 12 mins ahead, and told them I will be there soon for just one bibimbap (bibimbap is all pre-made, they just need to pack in a container), nothing was ready when I got there. My car was blinking on Yonge for another 10 mins until I really ran out of patience.. I think this would just be the last time I have ever visited the place. ..\n",
      "Horrible place. The thin pork belly tasted fine but it's super hard to manage on the grill, the thick pork belly is just horrible. The beef taste fine but the portion size is really small. Overall the price is too high and food are disappointing. Avoid at all cost.\n",
      "Their food is really good. But their servers are horrible. Also their times are not updated and will refuse to seat you. And sometimes will just refuse to seat you when their closing time is a little over an hour later.\n",
      "I have to give this place a three. It is hard to find great Chinese food that is t going to make me feel sick from all the oil. But boy is this place tasty. The shrimp fried rice, the egg drop soup, the tea!! So tasty. The lunch special is the best deal by far, I recommend it if you are working in the area. However, I give Sun a three because the horrible customer service. They are slow and almost always go over my one hour for lunch. I only won't 3 or 4 minds away so I find it silly that I am late.\n",
      "I used to come to this restaurant often when they were relatively new. Over the years I feel that quality has gone down the drain. \r\n",

      "What bother me the most was that dak gal bi, their signature dish ingredients,  well there is nothing there. \r\n",

      "The service was okay. It seemed like it was just the owner and maybe one other person doing everything. The place was empty and we waited roughly ten minutes for someone to get us a table. I don't have that much of a problem with the wait, but it was a little strange to me. I'm not entirely sure if he was the owner but the person who served us was apologetic for the wait. No big deal.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The food itself was, in my honest opinion, so-so. We did the self-cook grill table type thing. I'm not that experienced in the method yet, but I know what tastes good to me and what doesn't. The bul go gi was good, but the chicken was disappointing. It's not horrible, but I'm just not a fan of squishy chicken. The side dishes were good, but not all that amazing either. Maybe I'll go back to try something else.\n",
      "After driving about 4-5 hours and finishing a Mission trip, we had about 4 hours of free time until our flight. We were in the mood for some Korean food and after searching on Google we found this place. The reviews were not bad so we decided to eat there. Although we didn't make reservations, and maybe should have since we had a group of about 15, when we got there the lady was very surprised by the large group. She was complaining that we didn't call beforehand to make reservations, but it wasn't that busy, maybe 3 tables with a maximum of 4 customers. I know Korean restaurants in Dallas (where I am from) are busy on Friday nights. We told her that we are sorry and told her our situayion. As we sat down and looked at the menu I was very excited and couldn't choose what to eat. I was stuck between the Bulgogi and Ddukk Mandoo Gook (rice cake with dumpling soup) you can't go wrong with Bulgogi, but since I had it the night before at the mission trip I decided to go with the soup. This is where it all starts... As we were ordering, she got through our table/group with had about 10 people. When she got to the other table, she started complaining that we shouldn't order individual items and that it's going to take like an hour to get our food out. We repeatedly told her that it's okay, take your time, we have plenty of time. But she had an attitude. It felt like since it was a couple of hours before closing, they didn't want to work and serve customers. If you have that kind of mindset, you shouldn't run a restaurant at all. \r\n",
      "After all that ordering chaos I thought everything was gonna go smoothly and maybe we would have a nice chit chat and get to know more about each other since we're both Koreans from two different cities. But as the side dishes and rice came out, she only served 1 table, handed out rice to a few, left the tray (still with rice on it) on the empty table next to us, and one of the rice bowls had some red liquid stain on the rice, I wanna say it's from the Kimchi. \r\n",
      "When I got my Ddukk Mandoo Gook, it looked delicious. I tried it and that first sip burned my throat, not because of the temperature but because it was basically black pepper. It wasn't bad, but it was the most peppery soup I have ever tasted. I think I drank 3 cups of water and the Dumpling didn't have that much flavor, or because of the black pepper I couldn't taste anything. Another one of my members got the Galbi Tang (Beef Short Rib Soup). That took almost an hour to come out and when it did, the beef was completely frozen on the inside! That's when we all had it. If you're gonna complain that it's gonna take a long time for our foods to come out and we tell you that we have alot of time, at least cook the food! In the end, we weren't charged with that item but that will be the last time we will be visiting this restaurant. We go on a mission trip to Arizona every summer and thought maybe this restaurant could be our annual stop, but nope not after this horrible experience. We finished and payed for our meals and left a tip and pray that we will be the last customers who experience this.\n",
      "There's a reason this place closes down and opens under a new name every 3 months or so. \r\n",
      "Good luck trying to be seated when you walk in. There's no one to be found. If and when you do find someone, they're back in the kitchen doing god knows what. \r\n",
      "Then when you get seated it takes like 30 minutes to get your drink (even when the restaurant is completely empty).\r\n",
      "A word to the wise, when they take your drink order, put in your food order because your going to be waiting at least another 30 minutes for that. \r\n",
      "Oh, and forget about drink refills here. They're unheard of, just like seeing the waitress again after she delivers your meal. When your done eating and want your check you have to go hunt her down again from the kitchen. \r\n",

      "As my boyfriend was looking through the menu, he was so skeptical of what to get because this was new to him. Well, he didn't like his food of choice. We wanted to see the menu again, but she gave us nasty face as in, your going to oay for that meal right? The lady was very rude and wasn't apologetic at all. Didn't accommodate us or anything. \r\n",

      "Only two people worked there.  It was pulling teeth to get them to refill our drinks. It was just horrible.  I don't recommend this place to anyone.  :(\n",
      "This was the worst service we have ever received. We had to chase our waitress down twice and one time she was sitting on the phone not taking care of any of her tables. Our drinks were never filled (even alcoholic drinks which would have made them more money), we were scolded when we didn't know which meat was which when she brought it out. For a party of 7 to come to a restaurant for the first time and celebrate a special occasion, we expected to be treated well and yet we were ignored. All 7 of us will never come back to this horrible place. Her name was Judy so if you get her as your waitress just ask for someone else.\n",
      "Showed up place said opened but it looked close. Stood for 15 minutes no server or host so we sat ourselves someone showed up 15 minutes later walked by us didn't even acknowledged us that's when we walked out. There was another family eating there as well. Place was dead horrible customer service disappointed as this place was recommended by a friend.\n",

      "The food is just fine; i had bibimbap. But the service is horrible! horrible! I was shock by how terrible their service was! and also they impose 18% of gratuity on the bill, which doesn't make sense at all. The environment just makes me not want to go again :(\n",
      "I love that they let you order rice cakes in their pork bone soup. :) it's simple and delicious and you can modify the spicy levels which is great! They are fast, and always smiling, making for a great atmosphere to sit and enjoy a meal with friends and family.  \r\n",

      "I've never taste anything so horrible...just horrible. My friends and I ended up not eating anything except the fruits they gave us. How can they wasted so many good food materials? Rich, over cooked; Salmon, not fresh at all; Chick, still raw; Sauce, tasted bitter. \r\n",

      "The service was extremely slow and horrible.  The food was mediocre, and given the food quality and the horrible service, I could immediately tell why most people prefer Magal BBQ (and thus their rating is better).

Some people like myself like certain meats caramelized. And man are they stingy with their CORN! This is supposed to be an all you can eat menu according to which combo you choose and we chose the most expensive one and were allowed one corn thing! WTH? You can keep your dried up corn and your horrible staff and I def will not be recommending this place to anyone! \r\n",
      "Waste of time and money.\n",
      "Service is horrible. No one acknowledged us after we sat down for 10 minutes. No one came back to our table for any service after they took our order though out the whole dinner. It seems they don't care and don't want our business. Horrible service!!!\n",
      "This is the worst service I have ever received! The food was just okay... The server did smile one single time, when ever we needed anything she was no where to be found. We were there for my friends birthday and they made it a horrible experience. Then when it was time to pay they wanted to charge automatic gratuity of 18%! Are you kidding?! If they gave me automatic service then I would of had no problem, but for me to have to go on a search any time we need anything is ridiculous. I was our server. Then the cashier argued with me when I tried to explain to her the situation. I would never recommend.\n",
      "This place sucks!!! We came here because we wanted to check this place out, and it was opened late. Food wasn't great, service was horrible especially from the older server ladies who weren't friendly. It was overpriced for what we got! The meat lacked flavor and tasted old, so we barely ate. Gross!!! No thanks, we won't ever be back. What a waste of money! There's so many better Korean restaurants in Vegas.\n",
      "I'll get straight to the point. This is one horrible Korean restaurant that I've been to in the past 10 years.  The food is really bad, it makes frozen dinner tastes like a 5-stars restaurant. Customer service is horribly slow, I might as well go grab a refill for my drinks and my side dishes on my own.  Speaking of side dish, where the hell is the fish cake??   \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I ordered a tofu soup and it tasted like I was eating hot water. Absolutely NO flavor at all.  The BBQ meat also has no flavor, no seasoning at all, and you might as well save yourself $20 and cook it at home for half the price. The pricing is ridiculously outrageous for the quality of food and service you are getting, it feels like I'm being ripoff left and right. Gwenchansumnida!\n",
      "We have been going to this place for awhile. The food is generally very good and the service is not horrible. The atmosphere of the place is also very nice. This time however, a few things made me not want to return. I was washing my hands in the restroom before eating, and witnessed a waitress not wash her hands and return to work. This kind of thing really grosses me out, especially because at this establishment, they cook for you at your table. There are some flies that kept landing on our food at the beginning. But once they began cooking the meats, the smoke kept them away. Still, gross. Also they mandate an 18% tip for a party of 5 or more. Usually it is 6 people or more that is considered a large party. Usually we tip them well here because they do cook for you, but I dont like being forced or told how much to tip, particularly when I am now questioning the cleanliness of this facility. Don't know if I will be back.\n",
      "Not sure how the food is but I can tell you the service there is horrible.  Our party was sat at a table and when we were ready to order, I rang the chime they provide the customer to get the server's attention.  I rang it three times and still no waitress.  So, I left.  Not worth ever trying.\n",
      "Service is horrible! We ordered the B menus which is $25.99.  When we tried to order two corn cheese, the waitress told us it is limited 1 per table.  However, it didn't indicate on the menu.  I asked the waitress why it didn't say on the menu, she told me the owner changed it!  Also, the waitress is very rude and she always ignore us when we ask for help.  Bad rating!!!\n",
      "Should've read the previous reviews before eating here tonight as it was an awful experience. As another reviewer mentioned, the $20 dinner was not available so we had to pay for the $26 meal. Several of the appetizer items and a few of the meats that were supposed to be included in the meal were not available, yet there was no concession on the price. And on top of that the service was horrible. The waitress was downright rude, hardly came by to refill our drinks or allow us to order more food, and seemed annoyed when we actually were able to flag her down and request something. Both of the tables to the right and left of us said they couldn't get the waitress' attention. Customers were getting their own water, napkins, etc from other tables because no one was helping them. Save your money - the food and service were not worth the price. We felt ripped off.\n",
      "Service is horrible, they are like other business' out here on Spring Mountain this location has a pepper of good and bad service employees. So where to start?  Meats have no taste, there is nothing to suggest that they took out of the freezer and decided to season it.  When you ask for seasoning, it comes in little grams-literally.  So I could have done this at home.  I asked them politely to please let us handle the cooking of the meat, they rush you, they will cut your meat over and over again; hello would you like us to enjoy our meal or do you just want me out of your restaurant?  So they don't care what you tell them, they will keep on coming by and cutting forever.  The money is not worth it, I don't even remember how much, all I remember is the distaste to pay and never to return.\n",

It was only 5PM and the place was empty! We could have finished before 6:30 anyways. It is horrible that they wasted almost half and hour of our time just to kick us out. \r\n",

      "Came here and horrible experience. They gave us all menu's with options A, B, and C. We chose option C. A minute later our server said it wasn't available... we didn't understand WHY it wasn't available because we didn't NEED the EXTRA meats; intestines, and stuff. We don't eat that. Service was horrible, we requested for 6 except they gave us 5 waters, and 5 rice. We had to keep asking for that 6th water and rice... We felt neglected because we weren't Korean. The other tables were all Korean. Our server kept telling us hold on, hold on but then saw her attending to her Korean guest... we wanted to order more meats but our server took our menu and gave it to her new table.... on top of that she took our water to refill another table with water, very unprofessional, on top of that the 18% gratuity was included which we felt she never deserved it. Never coming back here again, we rather go and wait an hour and a half for better service where we are not treated like minorities.\n",
      "Very disappointed in the service. We were sat down by the hostess, 5 to 10 mins later no one came by until we flagged the hostess down by eye contact as she saw and noticed we were unattended nor taken care of. Even our menus were closed which should be a cue or indicator we are ready to order? Seeing that our waiter was managing several tables around us but the fact he failed to even stop by to even introduce himself and that he will be with us shortly. Even others that was seated after us and adjacent was even attended before us. Honestly I would not recommend this place based on this horrible first impression. With the addition of overpriced Korean fusion, the service was just not there to justify the overall experience. The food was just ok considering that I have dined at other concepts of Roy Choi's in LA. Take your business and experience and spend else where in Vegas that is worth your money.\n",

You can taste each one separately in different bites. Then we got the Los vegan salad. The fried rice was undercooked. The salad it self was better than any of the other options\r\n",

Tried variety of menu items and truly only enjoyed the slippery shrimp , the complimentary Hawaiian rolls , and the dessert strawberry cheesecake & Medjool date cake. Slippery shrimp was crispy & juicy and covered in some delicious spicy and tangy sauce .. should've ordered another one of this instead of the other items we got to be honest. Complimentary Hawaiian rolls had a nice touch with the sea salt and butter. Desserts were HUGE (felt like it was bigger than the appetizers & entrees lol). Strawberry cheesecake is my love - not only dessert had a nice presentation but cheesecake and the yuzu sorbet was tasty. Our server recommended the Medjool date cake and was not disappointed. The cake was warm & gooey and the toffee/salted caramel ice cream had some crunch inside. Date cake was more of a rich dessert while strawberry cheesecake was more refreshing - I'd still just get both :).\r\n",

      "The items I wouldn't recommend were the dumplings , Kogi short rib tacos , shaking beef saltado & kimchi fried rice. Well the dumplings , short rib tacos & kimchi fried rice were alright but tasted like any other ones you can find for half of the price. Shaking beef saltado wasn't anything special even for meat quality - too many peppers & onions and the side of french fries took up almost more than half of the plate.\n",

We were seated right beside the stairs and one of our party was worried she would back her chair up and tumble down the stairs.  There was also a horrible flashing light right above us that was making the whole table feel nauseated. The light had those edison bulbs that would make a clicking sound with every flash.  It also gave off a lot of heat.  I, in particular, who was sitting on the end, had to look away from the table in order to quell the nausea which made it difficult to carry on a conversation.  We asked the server if there was any way to turn off the flashing but they said they couldn't.  It seemed like we weren't the first to complain about it. \r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "1) For groups of two or more, the Kam Ja Tang is popular here. Unlike other restaurants, the pork bone soup is brought out on a burner and cooked at the table. Koreans seem to possess the inherent ability to consume liquids while on the boil...I prefer to preserve my taste buds. If you want to sound like a snob, make a comment to your table on the potatoes, as they're specific to these Korean dishes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "2) Typically bulgogi at restaurants is horrible, and one of the cheaper meat options. Not here, where (again, cooked at the table), the bulgogi is thicker, flavourful and delicious.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "3) If you're not looking for group items, try the Handmade Noodles with Dumplings in Beef Broth. This soup has a deep, rich flavour to it and is very satisfying. Add the ddok (rice cake medallions) if you want more starch.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "4) For something different, you could try the Jajang Myeon. Derived from a Chinese dish, these noodles are smothered in a thick (really thick) black soybean paste, minced pork and veggies. I typically can't finish a whole order myself (it's thick stuff), but Koreans can wolf this down like school girls at a Big Bang concert. Ask for scissors to save your wrists from chopstick-related strain.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The service can be hit or miss (I find there's a revolving contingent of young Korean males with varying degrees of competence), but don't be afraid to wave down anyone. Older Korean men typically don't give a damn and just shout out what they want. You could use the service bell glued to each table, but these are only responded to half the time.\n",
      "First i would like to say the food was delicious. Better than most kbbq places ive been to. But the service was horrible! We arrived at 630 and didnt leave until 830. There were empty tables but the waiter kept telling us there were people eating there. We also had to grab our own menus, repeatedly press the service button just to order (no one came.) We had to request for refills which took a few minutes for them to just grab a can from the back. The only time the servers came by our table was to give us our food and our check. We were never asked how the food was. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But like i said. The food was amazing, im just not sure if it was worth it for dealing with such bad service.\n",
      "My boyfriend and I went to Pepero on New Years because we both were craving Korean food and he hasn't been there so I thought why not? I've been there a few times in the past and the food was alright, nothing amazing nor horrible either. We were seated quickly, there was 3 tables occupied. There were two servers, the guy took the table to our left, the girl took the front table and ours. Maybe 15 minutes later, the table to our left got their food first. 2 big group of people came in during that time and got seated quickly and got their orders in too. About another 30 minutes went by, one of the big group got their food. Another 10 minutes after that, the second big group got theirs. By that time, one hour has past and neither the front table or us have got our food BUT the two big group who came 15 minutes after us got theirs. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I understand the 2 big groups may bring in more money but that is not how you treat your customers! I heard the front tables order and they didn't order a lot of food, neither did we. I was patient enough to wait one hour and my food was still not on the way so we left. I will NOT be coming back and will NOT recommend this place to anyone because service is TERRIBLE!!!\n",
      "Given that there aren't many other Korean restaurants to choose from in Charlotte, I'm being generous with the 3 stars. Their banchan was horrible. I'm almost always hungry, so I usually start scarfing down banchan as soon as it comes out. At PePeRo, I hardly touched any of it. Most of their banchan tasted like it had been sitting around for a few days. Their galbi tasted ok, but all of the pieces were small and mostly fatty. Their yook gae jang, though not the most appetizing to look at, was decent and also the only reason I might try this place again if I need to satisfy my Korean food craving.\n",
      "Now the food is exceptional, very authentic. But the service...YIKES! Send help literally. We dined there yesterday and literally had to ask for refills of water (we got one refill during the entire dinner). We had to constantly ask for napkins and refills of our small plates. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "No one checked on us and it began to feel like we were begging for their service. It got to the point when we had already eaten and was waiting for the check for no joke, 1 hour. They did have a few other customers, and were very short staffed but we literally had to just go stand by the door with cards in hand to show that we were ready to go. We were stuck there for two hours. Keep in mind we only had ONE water refill and a total of 6 napkins amongst the three of us. I'm going to give them some time to work on their service issue. But I will return solely for the food; it maybe best to take it to-go. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Love the food but the service is horrible.\n",
      "The only reason we are ordering food here is because of being 24hrs.\r\n",
      "There is a lady that seems like being the owner of the place and she doesnt care about anything but money .\r\n",
      "I dont like the cali roll in my bento box because its has no nutrition value, so I always change the roll with some other roll of exact price in the menu ,but here she's trying to charge us for it,even if its the same price roll ,also she's not willing to put a six piece roll in the bento box even when she's charging extra ,she's putting a 4 piece roll instead of a six while she already charged me for an extra 2-3 bucks .\r\n",
      "She's a horrible person to deal with and being very rude all the time ,like when im asking her to serve me my food the way i want it she's like : this is it , want it or not?\r\n",
      "And sadly i have to get it because as i said earlier this is the only place around that serving sushi until 3AM.\r\n",
      "If this restaurant is not your only option ,dont even think about it .there are plenty sushi places around that they are pleased to serve you , the way you want your food( moto sushi is my favorite ) \r\n",
      "I wish I cloud give this place 0 star review.\n",
      "This is my first time writing a review about a restaurant on Yelp, because I really hope everyone looking at this review will never ever go to this restaurant. Worst possible restaurant I've ever been to in my life. Yelp should offer option of giving 0 star.\r\n",
      "Three of us that went there last night had a flounder sashmi combo. We had to return dishes twice because they had disgusting food stains over them. I'm the type of guy who just wipe it away if I see a little stain on dish, but these looked like they didn't even wash them. Side dishes were horrible. Tempura tasted like they used old oil for extended length of time. White rice we ordered separate were so watery. Sashimi was not fresh at all. Oysters were so salty and tasted partially rotten, that we spat it out right away. Salmon skin rolls were bad too of course since they can't cook rice right. Slices of raw garlic was cut so thick and dry, that it looked like a 12 year old cut it with a plastic knife. Severs didn't bother checking on us. We had to wave our hands at the servers at least 3 times to order more drinks. We went there after a long day of home moving, for mainly to drink with Sashimi and have a good time so we tried our best to enjoy positively and leave, but I really wanted to shove up the food they served into the mouth of whoever is managing that place and hear what they think.\n",
      "MSG overload. The spicy kimchi pork belly (kimchi jeyuk bokkeum) was so spicy from too much pepper flakes. The black bean noodles (jjajangmyun) was from MICROWAVE INSTANT PACKET!!! OMG IT TASTES EXACTLY THE SAME AS OTTUGI (3minute jjajangmyun sauce). The side dishes tasted horrible too. Never again. The only good dish here was the watermelon slice they give out for free at the end of the meal.\n",
      "This restaurant was disappointing to both me and my friend last night. On a Friday night I do expect it to be busy but service was just beyond horrible. We waited at least 25~30 minutes and got our ddubboki appetizer (7.95$). I was expecting decent ban chan but everything was extremely bland or lacking flavours. Even the kimchi tasted odd. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My friend and I each ordered a typical Korean dish, she got the pork bone soup (8.95$) and I got the soon tofu with seafood (8.95$). We both agreed it was spicy, hot in temperature but besides that there was no flavours again it was bland and extremely disappointing. The pork bone soup had mostly bones and very little meat. The soon tofu had minced tofu and minimal seafood. I do not understand how this place can have such awful food. The menu also was limited to mostly spicy food items. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Overall, if you're looking for a Korean restaurant don't bother coming here. The service was bad also because there was 1~2 ladies running around. It was also hard to get their attention when we wanted the bill. Sorry Korea house, you are on my list of never again will I eat here. Such a waste of money seriously. We left here equally hungry.\n",
      "The tiramisu is horrible!!! \r\n",
      "It taste like \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It's only good for Instagram photos..\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Feel free to pass on this stupid trendy place...\n",
      "Their main menu Fried Chicken tastes terrible, worst experience ever. Never had that terrible chicken in my life. Also the chicken feet is horrible. Actually my standard for food is very low. I wasted $70 on uneatable food. Wish there are no more people waste money there.\n",
      "Seoul used to be our go to Korean restaurant.  It recently changed to all you can eat for $30, which includes a buffet which looked so horrible.  The food looked dried, over cooked and sitting all day.  We ordered our meat to be cooked in the kitchen and there was so much sauce that after each piece of meat, we had to drink a cup of tea.  Hopefully they'll go back to how things used to be and not charge $2 for lettuce.\n",
      "Chinese food is generally speaking horrible for you, but this place bucks the trend. They use healthy fresh ingredients, and don't drown the meals in sauce. I've had the whole menu and can say I've liked everything. Great prices too.\n",
      "Worst experience here! 4.5 stars? Come on Toronto!\r\n",
      "The service was horrible and involved the waitress slamming down side plates WITH A SCOWL without even making eye contact or acknowledging me. I noticed the side plates weren't very exiting; some places have really good ones. No seconds were offered. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The food was ok but not any better than anywhere else. The prices were more expensive than other places in the area. They do not accept any credit cards at all OR debit cards on transactions of under $20. No cash only sign on door. Was forced to use their RIP-OFF ATM machine which of course has a fee. How sleazy of them to treat their customers like that, to save themselves a 30 cent fee. Hope it's even safe. Such a horrible experience at every step. I'll be returning to my usual Korean place where it comes to $11 and it's way better.\n",
      "One of my favourite places for pork bone! The soup broth was so delicious and flavourfull, you can tell that they did not water down the soup. It tasted like it was slow cooked for hours and and the meat was how it should be fall off the bone. I've had horrible pork bone soup from other places where the broth was bland and had no taste and the pork was hard and barely any meat. When I go with my boyfriend we usually order the tofu soup or the pork bone soup and sometimes if we're really hungry we get the galbi short ribs or the spicy pork bulgogi. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The waitresses are always very polite and friendly and the owner is always there when I go eat. If our table was too small for the amount of food we had he would push another table together for us so that we had more room. I came here in the first few months that they opened and now it's just so busy.\n",
      "I don't know why I ever order from this place anymore. I always order delivery and when it used to come from the Yonge-Bloor location, it was always pretty good.  But ever since I moved near this location, the food has been horrible. I swear the Pad Thai (their signature dish) I got tonight had zero flavor. It was just a bunch of red noodles and chunks of chicken. There weren't even any peanuts. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "If this were the first time, I would call and complain, but this has been going on for months. What a waste of money! With 50 million other Thai places in Toronto, go somewhere else. These guys were great, but it's time for them to go out of business.\n",
      "Not a fan of Asian fusion to begin with, but this place is just the worst. I've been here a couple of times and I have always walked out wondering why I wasted my time and money at this place. I'm writing this review to remind myself to try my absolute best to never come back again. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "If you're a fan of huge portions of bland food this is where you need to be for the AYCE! If otherwise, this is a complete waste of time and money. It took a while for the orders to come around. Throughout the meal we ordered dumplings, sushi, tempura, some soups, seaweed salad, mango salad, Pad thai, and fried rice. The dumplings were probably some of the worst I've ever had, hard and dry wrappers with just a weird taste for the filling. The siu mai were especially off. I swear if you walked up the street to Chinatown and bought a couple bags of frozen dumplings and heated them up at home you'd be doing yourself a favor. Pad-thai was AWFUL, basically just a plate of bland noodles. Their sushi is not horrible but for the price of the AYCE you are better off going to a more authentic Japanese sushi place. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Their a la carte priced menu is not all completely disgusting. Pretty comparable to mall food court Asian food unfortunately, just plated nicely with garnishes and a few fresh ingredients. Again stay away from the Pad Thai!!! I would never recommend this place to anyone but if you find you are forced to lunch with some friends at Spring Rolls and they will not be swayed by the close proximity of this location (like I was) you might be better off with a la carte.\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The moment I walk in, there is no hostess at the front, but that's ok- she was prob busy with some other customer. However, I see two waitresses right behind the front desk chatting away infront of the cash desk. One of them turns around and looks at me, to be exact, gives me a really bitchy look. Uh.....WHY? I am just here to eat! Plus would it really kill you to just say hello and tell me that the hostess will be with me shortly? I do understand that they are only hired as a waitress so it's not exactly their job, but don't make the customers feel awkward by just staring at them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After we sit down, the waitress comes over. She is THE most awkward waitress I've ever dealt with. She asks me if I've been here before, I answer 'yes' and she just laughs awkwardly.....Why did you even ask me that question if you are going to laugh? I didn't say anything funny. She tells me about the Special of the day, I can't even understand her cause she is mumbling and looking at the table next to us.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ordered: SINGAPOREAN CURRY VERMICELLI, This dish was actually decent, it's not really spicy at first but the curry flavor kicks in after few bites. This was good with hot sauce.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ordered: SPECIAL PAD THAI WITH TIGER SHRIMP, They have few different types of Pad Thai and you get to choose between Shrimp, Chicken and Vegetables. This had very odd neon ketchup color to it, almost unnatural. It came with big shrimp pieces but tasted very food-court-like.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ordered: TOM YOUNG SOUP + JASMINE RICE, Tom Young Soup was way too sweet it was almost like spicy dessert. I've been to Thailand and had authentic Tom Young Soup so I know how it's suppose to taste. I do understand Spring Rolls is asian fusion based but this was just horrible. I am upset that people in Toronto will eat this thinking it's good when it doesn't even taste like it's suppose to.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Little more on service, their staff needs major training. It's THE most awkward/unplesant service I ever had with franchise restaurants. Other than the waitress issue I've mentioned before, their busser needs to be re-trained. After my last bite, I was still mid-way of putting down my fork, he appears out of nowhere and just grabs my plate. OK so I realize I am done eating, but you don't just immediately grab them without asking. This is a restaurant, I am not eating here for free. I am paying for my food AND service, so don't rush me. And then he wanted to grab other plates that still had food and I had to stop him. WHATS THE RUSH DUDE? Leave us alone!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Waitress was never there when we looked for her, yet the busser was in my face and getting on my nerves when I didn't even need him. And of course, the waitress checked off the last box of worst service sheet by taking forever with the cheque.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Summary: Was the food bad? it's mediocre. Will I go back? if I had choice I would rather walk down another block and go to a chinese restaurant. Other than convenience, it never really impressed me and now with the horrible staff? I am never going back.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "*chomp chomp*\n",
      "I'm surprised this restaurant is still in business because the food is just bad.  I went for early dinner with my best friend there because we decided to give it another chance after 4 years of not going here.  And it has reconfirmed my decision to never go back again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Firstly, the decor is nice I have to give them that and the atmosphere is quite trendy and relaxing.  It is the typical fashionable, trendy and hip restaurant that you would see as you pass by on the streets and think it's a very nice place.  \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Secondly, my friend ordered a pad thai and it was barely warm, the colour was really off and she said the taste was far from good.  As for my plate, I ordered some beef dish with rice and as well the food was barely warm, the sauce was watery and the taste was so simple.  A bowl of cereal and milk at home would have been twice as good.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lastly, the service sucked!!!  Most real authentic Chinese restaurants dont have such a thing as excellent service and I dont expect it because you go there for food and not service.  But at Spring Rolls, it's Asian FUSION, the key word.  I would expect some decent service considering the prices are not your daily food court cheaps.  Our server did not ask to take our drink orders, she didn't even come to us for at least 10 minutes.  She never asked us about how our food was nor did she recommend desserts or coffee/tea.  \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Damn this place is the WORST I've ever gone to and will NEVER ever go back.  It was a complete waste of money and I'm someone who just appreciates having food on my plate and all things unless horrible just tastes good to me, but this one has got to go!\n",

      "I had been to the Spring Rolls chain restaurants numerous times (Yonge Street, Front Street, and Sheppard/Yonge) and the food and the experience has always been great. I actually have been to this Eaton Centre location previously two summers ago and recall that the food and service at that time had been good. So to my great detriment, I actually entered the restaurant with my girlfriends with high expectations (why wouldn't I? Its a chain isn't it? Aren't chains supposed to be consistent?). I realise that I had set myself up for a huge disappointment. Here is why.... \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The moment we got there we were seated right away. As we sat down, we only had Dim Sum menus so we had to ask for the regular menu. Then the waiter came by to ask us if we wanted any drinks. My girlfriends replied no and before I could also reply, the waiter had left to tend to another table next to us. So after he was done talking at the other table and turned around, I got his attention and asked him if i could get hot water with lemon because i had a sore throat. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So our waters came and the waiter had brought me hot water in the smallest coffee mug that I have ever seen in my life. Who does he think i am? A child age 5? There was also no lemon. Moving on....so our food came - we ordered beef pad Thai and the beef tasted off...like it had gone bad but they cooked it anyway. Strike no. 1 Our Chinese vegetable dish came too and that dish tasted fine. So we waited and waited but our green curry chicken rice dish did not show up. We had waited over an hour and the dish had not yet appeared. Could the kitchen have forgotten about our order? To hold us over we ordered two dim sum dishes. One of the dished - the shrimp dumplings was ok but the lotus leaf sticky rice was not only just luke warm, but the lotus leaf was dry as hay. We were suspicious as to how the lotus leaf could be dry if they had to steam the dish. Apparently the dish did not look fresh so we told them to take it back. So strike no. 2. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then my girlfriend ordered a hot water from a different waiter and the waiter brought her this large Japanese teacup wrapped in a napkin with two lemons from the side. I was baffled and wondered why our own designated waiter had brought me the small mug which was half the size of the tea cup and no lemons. As i looked around at other tables i also noticed other patrons with the same large Japanese tea cup with hot water and lemons on the side. I was really under impressed with our waiter. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then finally our green curry rice dish came out but the dish was luke warm and looked as though it had been sitting out for a long time. So we told one of the other waiters about this and the manager came to our table. We told him that our Beef was off in the pad Thai dish and that the lotus leaf dim sum dish was dry as hay, and that the curry rice dish looked like it had been sitting around for a long time. So the manager suggested that they remake the beef pad Thai and we just said no thanks. Then he said he would not charge us for that dish. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He took the chicken curry dish back to the kitchen and said he would ask them to make us a new one. So they come back with the same chicken dish a few minutes later (still lukewarm) but it looked like someone had just thrown the dish back into a wok and reheated it. So we ate it and nothing about the dish tasted fresh. The tofu tasted old, the vegetables were overcooked, and there was no flavor other than spiciness. I had this dish previously many times but it never tasted this bad before. Strike no. 3.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "While we waited for our bill to come, we saw people sitting two tables down from us with food that arrived at their table with steam that was coming out of it.  Not sure why their food looked hot as though it had just been prepared and everything we were served was not only not steaming, but looked like it had been sitting on the counter for over an hour (which incidentally is how long we had waited for our dish rice dish). \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So, we paid for our food and left but by the end we couldn't order anything else there because we had all lost our appetite. The idea of eating anything else that was not fresh and potentially past expiry was more than what our minds could handle, nevermind our stomachs. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I was actually shocked that the food and the overall experience was so bad. Although the decor is nice, the service (maybe just our waiter) and the food was horrible. I do not recommend this location. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When you walk out of a restaurant wondering if you might be sick later in the day, its just not a good feeling.  Luckily, none of us got sick.  Eitherway, I still think I'd rather eat anywhere else but there because after 3 strikes, you are OUT.\n",
      "Over priced. The food is okay and underwhelming. My fried banana dessert was terrifyingly horrible. How can you get such a simple dessert wrong. The star rating says it all so I shall let it do most of the talking.\n",
      "This review is for ACYE only. If you are looking for good authentic food, I would not recommend this place. If you are looking for extensive menu, fun dining with a group/date, nice ambience, and don't mind subpar fusion food I would recommend. The ACYE menu had many items of Japanese, Korean, Chinese, and Thai food which made it fun. For appetizers, we tried the sui mai, shrimp dumpling, salt & pepper calamari, honey garlic wings, tempura shrimp, satay chicken skewers, and spring rolls. All were fine although the wings were very plain. They ran out of miso soup so we tried the hot and sour soup. It tasted horrible and odd. The pad thai and red curry were bland also. The Korean kalbi was ok. It was the only dish we ordered twice. The bulgogi beef lacked bulgogi taste. Curry lamb chop was ok. We ordered lots of sashimi (raw salmon, snapper, tuna) and one roll. The sushi roll was poorly made but maybe because it was ACYE. Everything was sloppier (and perhaps less tasty?) for AYCE customers. Their mini cupcake desert is something you buy at the store. Mango cream brulee was pretty lame. Ice cream was ok. Our server was fine; although very busy she tried to get us what we needed when she could. Overall, 2/5 on food and I wouldn't come again. Just good for a one-time experience.\n",
      "The place is nice in terms of decor and atmosphere.\r\n",
      "The menu is also extensive.\r\n",
      "The service is horrible, rude, slow, and snotty.\r\n",
      "The food is mediocre.\n",
      "Wish I could give no mark at all this is a terrible place to spend money I had a  seafood pad Thai  seconds ago and it was terrible  no salt at all I mean noooo salt I spoke with the waiters and good luck her English is bellow ZERO \r\n",
      "Spoke to the manager she said we will address the issue to the chef they never refund me the $18.07 and there was 3 shrimps that's it... I wll never ever give them my $$ \r\n",
      "Such a poor service un tasty food horrible .\r\n",
      "This place for white people or someone never had food in his house so won't notice the difference don't be fouled with pictures taste the food then mark it .\r\n",
      "Simply !! They should close down. How they survived?\r\n",
      "From the idiots who given them money like me tonight\n",
      "This place is fashionable, but horrible.  I was doing some shopping and needed to feed so I stopped by here to fill my belly since it was lunch and I wanted something light.  I got the duck wraps on a bed of greens.  They were not good.  Not good at all.  The taste was boring and just one or two notches below frozen food.  The greens were fresh and the dressing fine, but after eating two segments of the 4-piece wrap and half the greens I saw it... like a stark black line drawn directly onto reality between me and my lunch...there was a hair in my food.  Oh wait, not one, THREE hairs in my food.  \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At least I didn't have to pay for my half-eaten half-edible lunch.\n",
      "I knew this was going to be a horrible experience before I even arrived, mainly because I loathe chain restaurants, but some friends from the 905 were visiting and this was their food pick before our movie night.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I don't want to go into detail, but really, the food is SH!TE. We had the All You Can Eat dinner for $24.99 and after sampling 15 different things, there were only 1-2 that were even tasty. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The dim sum was the most disgusting thing I have ever eaten. The har gow was a bit chewy mass of dough, shu mai was bland and gross looking. The sushi was mediocre and the sashimi I ordered (5 pieces) were laughably small and took about 20 minutes to arrive at the table. The various stir fries and thai food all tasted as if they had been reheated by microwave or prepared from frozen or something.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The service was hit and miss too - our server came by often, but they kept forgetting things, and it took us AGES to get out of there and pay.\n",
      "Worst Service! Very Rude and un professional. Don't even think about going here. Sushi was horrible and also the entrees were just as bad. Over priced! Avoid this place and save yourself time and money.\n",
      "I've been to this location twice over the past year, the most recent being last night for a school networking event. Like others have mentioned, choose Spring Rolls for the ambiance (sit down, formal relative to the countless fast food joints in this area), not for the food. Considering its super convenient location next to the Eaton Centre and part of the PATH at the very north end (financial district workers- you guys can come here from your offices without traveling outside at all), I wasn't expecting the food to be out-of-this-world good. And that's pretty much how it was last night. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Food- 2/5. Not that great. I ordered the Tom Yum Soup (app), Thai Basil Spicy Eggplant (main), and fried banana + brownie bites (dessert). Never order the Tom Yum Soup - it tasted pretty flavorful actually, but I wonder how much of that flavor (especially the sweetness and umami) was actually natural. The presentation was horrible - looked like someone splashed in it first with tomato sauce caked all around the bowl rim and big oil blobs covering the surface. There were very few pieces of cherry tomatoes and tiny pieces of chicken. The Thai Basil Spicy Eggplant was not bad! Also very oily, but the eggplant was cooked just right imo - not too mushy, not too crunchy. Also contained many large pieces of skinless, boneless chicken. The entire dish is NOT spicy btw unless you choose to munch on the peppers. The milkshakes here apparently tasted like real fruit, which is a great start, but not as creamy/milky as say, a mango lassi. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Value- Since I didn't pay last night I can only comment from my 1st time experience here. Overpriced? Probably, given the below average portion sizes for apps and mains (you won't be boxing anything for the next meal), but not outrageous. Take your hard earned $$ to Salad King or Asian Bowl (both nearby and count as Asian fusion) for bigger portions, better value, and a louder/less classy experience.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Service- 3/5. Superrrrr slow for food to come, both times that I was here. All the servers were friendly and helpful though\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Venue- 4/5. Pretty classy for this chaotic, touristy area. Can get loud especially when the restaurant fills up at dinnertime as customers sit so close together. They have a downstairs and upstairs with upstairs being generally louder, but at least they have natural lighting and a street view. Good place for a more formal event (i.e. business lunch).\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Overall, will not be back intentionally, but not opposed to grabbing a quick dinner here another day.\n",
      "bwahahahaha.\r\n",
      "ahhhhh hahahahaha.\r\n",
      "WTF?????????????\r\n",
      "bwahahahaha. \r\n",
      "ahhhhh hahahahaha.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "i think my semi-mentally-challenged-Jack Russell Terrier can cook a better meal using only his canned dog food better than Spring Rolls. seriously... WTF?  i thought NY had some pretty horrible Thai restaurants, but damnnnnnnnnnn yo! \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "i don't even want to comment on what the hell we ordered- because everything tasted exactly the same. DISGUSTING and NOT THAI. lol\n",
      "We went on a Friday evening, and the food was horrible. The sushi was the worst quality sushi you could have, especially for the price. The fried appetizers weren't too bad, but I've definitely had better. Wouldn't recommend this place for sushi\n",
      "We were staying at the Marriott at Eaton Centre and ordered takeout to watch the Oscars. Our meals were absolutely horrible. We used to love this restaurant years ago. Pad Thai was disgusting. Spring rolls were just mush. Sushi roll was fishy tasting. Definitely not fresh and dim sum was disgusting. Very very disappointed\n",
      "Worst korean food (maybe overall worst experience) experience. Ordered monk fish, stewed duck and bi bimbab for 3 of us. Non of us was able to eat our food. It tasted weird. Also when we wanted to pay we wanted to leave only 2 dollars tip since service and food quality was horrible. They asked for more tips. Never seen a restaurant like this in toronto. Absolutely not recommended.\n",
      "First and last time. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Good side dishes but very bland main dishes. We were given the option to add on salt and other sauce, but it did not change anything. The customer service was nothing but horrible. Got rushed to order and forced to pay a certain percentage of tips. You will get the right amount of tips if you provide the decent type of customer service, simple.\n",
      "*sigh*\r\n",
      "I really don't like the service here.  I've been here twice and both times were horrible.  They usually take a long time, and you can just feel the unfriendliness.  \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The food is ok.  They gave our brisket frozen once.  And one time, they gave the wrong meat.  We ate it anyway though.  Usually, I'll give a place slack for having good food.  This time, the food didn't make up for the service.  it was just ok to me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "If you're looking for a good AYCE KBBQ place, I suggest WooChe.  I'll only come back here if I'm having a late night craving.  They open late and the price is pretty good after 11.  Other than those reasons, I'd rather go elsewhere.  Lol.. ^_^\n",
      "Waitress/hostess is horrible.  I asked her in Korean how long the wait was and she COMPLETELY ignored me.  I am used to bad service in Korean restaurants but this is first time a waitress did not even make eye contact.  Food is average.   Wait was long but only because they only have 6 tables with grills.  It definitely is not because of their food.\n",
      "I love the tofu soups they taste amazing! It was little spicy for me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I give the food a 5 star \r\n",
      "Service 1 star.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But the service is horrible.  They didn't fill our water and when we paid they were surprised we paid with a large bill.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I'll go back but only to the sister store Don.\n",
      "This place isn't horrible, but you definitely get what you pay for. The chicken carried a gelatinous consistency regardless of how long it was cooked. The ribeye was awesome, great flavor every time it was cooked. There's a way better option on Maryland parkway and Algonquin across the street from a Blue Berry Hill. Much better service, environment, and food. It's a little more expensive, but well worth the price.\n",
      "Service here is horrible!  They always seem to forget that were there. And there's always an Asian guy here who gives attitude as he's serving us.  Maybe because we always get all you can eat KBBQ and we can eat like bottomless pits.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As me and my friends quickly eat the first serving of brisket, we ask for another, we notice something different, turns out they gave us beef tongue instead.\n",
      "Since the horrible experience I had a long time ago there are two gentlemen that runs the place when I come in now, usually from 8pm - 3am.  When these two are running the place then service is top notch.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I only come here for the very affordable all you can eat Korean BBQ.  Pick and choose what you prefer but I always stick with the brisket, short ribs, and marinated short ribs.  \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "You'll get the sides automatically and rice but instead of rice I like to ask for the greens/salad.  Even though it gets really busy at night, these two-men duo gives you superb service.\n",
      "The food is good but the service was absolutely horrible.  This bitch was hiding behind the counter so she doesn't have to bring us more meat and whatever else that we needed.  And when we finally got her attention she gave us attitude and horrible gesture.  I lost my fucking appetite after that and didn't eat. And it's the same bitches that work there all the time.  But what do you expect from cheap Korean restaurant, cheap food=shitty workers\n",
      "HORRIBLE customer service!! Door says open till 2 am, they REFUSED us service at 12:40 am. When I questioned their choice of service, they said they had a wait and threatened to call the police, despite the fact that I was requesting nicely for a table. Normally would eat here, but this horrible, harassment level customer service shows that this company doesn't care about their guests. I've worked over ten years in the customer service industry and I've never been treated so cruelly before. I warn anyone who wants to eat here, please stay away.\n",
      "I used to really like Tofu Hut. I thought the late night special was such a great deal! $13.99 after 10pm. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "However, I recently got back from Korea where I had Korean bbq constantly. It was more expensive to eat Korean bbq there, but the meat quality was so much better. The last time I went to Tofu Hut, the meat was horrible. The Kalbi was tough. Most of the meat was tough and dry. I really enjoyed the steam egg and the salad, but I was not eating Korean Bbq to eat those items. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The service was decent. It was neither good or bad. Nothing worth noting about. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The meat quality was pretty horrible, and I don't know the next time that I will be returning.\n",
      "I like to think of this place as your average KBBQ places. want Korean BBQ but don't really feel like spending that much and have some time to kill? tofu hut is your place! \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "it's really affordable compared to other Korean BBQ places in Vegas. but because of that, expect a long wait. sometimes you'll get lucky and get seated right away. but if it's the weekend, lunch or dinner time, or if you have a big party...expect about 45mins to an hour long wait. I don't know if the food is worth the wait, but the price definitely is! \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "but if you don't want Korean BBQ and you just want some Korean food, there's the other side of the restaurant for that. there's never any wait on that side, so you can seat yourself and eat pretty much right away! I really like their tofu soup there! my favorite kinds are the kimchee beef and dumpling. it's just really good and comforting! \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I only gave this place 3 stars because I think of this place as just average. they're not horrible, but they're also not breathtakingly awesome, you know what I mean? but to just satisfy your Korean food craving? it'll do.\n",
      "This is probably the most disgusting food I have ever had in my life and I am a big fan of McDonald's and street food so please don't think I am rich, snobby, and only dine where the rich and famous do, lol.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The wait was horrible. About 45 minutes. When we were seated, the server did not explain ANYTHING to us. This is one of those places where you cook your own food. We had to GOOGLE instructions for how long to cook certain things. I have been to other places where you cook your own food and they explain the minutes to cook certain foods for and are generally available with any questions. We never saw our server again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "You guessed it...it came out awful. But it wasn't just our awful cooking skills (which I do take partial blame for) but the meat was incredibly disgusting. Dry, room temperature, grey, sometimes brown, just looked like it had been sitting out for a long time. Also the sides were equally disgusting so I know it wasn't all because we cooked it badly. It just tasted like they left yesterday's food out on the counter and brought us that to eat.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I didn't get sick from it but it just left a disgusting taste in my mouth and my stomach. I actually found myself purposely vomiting as my own vomit tasted better than their garbage food. I wanted it out of my system immediately. The thought of it makes me want to hurl again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I don't see what the hype is about this place: bad service, bad food. Will never return. I don't have other Korean BBQ spot recommendations but don't come here.\n",
      "horrible service, the line was 20minutes long even though there were open tables. they made us switch seats just because we can't just get one order of meat. they said you're not allowed to order just one plate of meat which makes no sense.\n",
      "I just ate at tofu hut for the first time because its the cheapest all u can eat in las vegas at 16.99.  I have many complaints about this place. So half of the restaurant is all u can eat the other half is sit in. So in total on the all u can eat side is about 8 tables. So first let me start with the side dishes. I am korean so i know my korean food and ive been to many korean restaurants. I have never been to a restaurant whose side dishes were so untasty. The kimchee was way to sour and salty and mushy. The odang was soo mushy that u couldn't even chew it. The korean pancake was way to hard. The clear noodles (chapchee) only had noodles and the only flavor in it was soy sauce. The only thing that was slightly edible was the cucumber. The meat they served was mediocre. It was edible but not delicious. They take FOREVER  to bring the meat. We would keep ordering meat when they would bring us a plate and by the time we got our next round of meat we had already finished the first portion and waited so long the grill got burned. The portions of meat was so small. We ordered galbi they brought us two slices and the slices half of it was just straight fat. They also dont use real galbi they use skirt part of the meat not short ribs. So they charge an extra 3 dollars just to include the galbi in the all u can eat and its not even real short ribs. So even though its the cheapest korean bbq around i will never return to this place i rather pay the 21.99 that everywhere else charges to have a better experience. This place just failed at every turn. Side dishes horrible, meat was mediocre, and service was horrible as well.\n",
      "I will never go to this place again. The quality of food is very poor and the servis is terrible. I wound not recommend this horrible place.\n",
      "We decided to have some soft tofu soup that they should be known for. The layout of the restaurant is one side is the grill tables for AYCE Korean BBQ and the other side is for the non grill area. The grill side was packed with people. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We sat to have Soft tofu soup and dolsot bibimbap. We had to sit ourselves and get our own menus. After waiting twenty minutes, they finally took our order. They only have three workers working both sides of the room. We order a cold noodle dish which they didn't have. They messed up our order even though I confirm with him twice. It was loud and you couldn't hear yourself. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Overall, service was horrible! Food was bland. I will not be returning at all. In the past, I remember their soup having good flavor, but now, no taste. Again, thumbs down. Don't go.\n",
      "This place gets my vote for the worst KBBQ experience ever. The meats were awful and poor quality. Also worth mentioning is their horrible banchan. It was not fresh nor did it taste good. I usually ask for seconds or thirds when it comes to banchan too. It made me really miss the L.A. KBBQ joints. The soon tofu was extremely, uncomfortable spicy! It gave me really bad heartburn. I can handle spicy food too.\n",
      "We went to Tofu Hut because mr. Tofu is closed on sunday. A few tables were bbqing meat and we ordered one sun-tofu and one guk-su. The side dishes were all suck!! Jab-che was over seasoned with too much soysauce. Kimchi was too old and jun was all burned. One side of jun was all black and tasted nothing more than flour. Sun-tofu was not bad but not good either. We ordered spicy but it wasnt spicy at all. Guk-su was terrible. Too much vinegar was used.. i almost threw up while eating. Staff was not bad. They walj around with ice water and refill it everytime you ask. Overall i will never go back. I cant believe tofu hut became this horrible. It wasnt used to be this bad. I will rather wait until mr. Tofu opens on weekdays. Please do taste before serving dishes to customers!!!\n",
      "The bbq was moderate, however, the service is horrible. Our server was definitely either having a bad day or Hayes his job. :\\\\\n",
      "BLEH!!!!!! This place ain't what it used to be.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I'm sure no actual Korean people come and eat here. At least for sundubu that is. It tasted bland, there were no good flavors, the banchan was horrible. What a lifeless drab of a meal. On top of that, the bill wasn't even that affordable.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I think they're just kept busy because of tradition. This is one of the oldest Korean tofu houses in Las Vegas, and people have come to recognize it. PEOPLE --- I implore you to expand your horizons and venture to new places. Try Mr. Tofu literally across the street. That'll be a step in the right direction.\n",
      "I went to Tofu Hut the other night for the late night special. I got there around 10:00, and signed my name on the list. Boy was the wait long. We had to wait 30 minutes for a party of 3. Once we sat down, we ordered out food quickly.  Our food arrived pretty quickly because we were cooking it ourselves. We ordered my favorites which is beef tongue, brisket, pork belly, and sliced ribeye (my friend assumed ribeye was a good thing. She didn't know it was bulgolgi.) The beef tongue slices were pretty small, but everything else was delicious. We also ordered the soup which is a bean paste soup. Over the years, they have tried to reduce costs. They no longer include tofu in their soup. :( I love Korean bbq.  \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I love when my pork belly is crispy and I love to dip my meat in samjang which is a sauce you are able to ask them for as they don't automatically bring it out.  I love the salad that comes with it. It tastes awesome!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Service was a little lacking. They were super busy, which I can understand. $13.99 is a great deal for Korean bbq.  At first it didn't matter because we were just eating and enjoying our food. But eventually we did want our waters filled, and we did want squid.  They do have pretty awesome bancahn. I love the japchae and the fish cake. I prefer my kimchi to be riper. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Pretty good deal for $13.99. I think the tofu soup is horrible here. Go to Mr. Tofu for that. It's just across the street! For Korean bbq, this is a good deal!\n",
      "A lot of people really like this place but it really didn't do anything for me. The short ribs are good and the salad is good. I guess it's good for the price you pay but I still prefer to pay a little more to have the things I do like. We did the all you can eat yakiniku (they have the other side which has more options but not ayce style). We came with a party of 11 no reservations so it was a semi long wait. The wait did seem forever because we were starving. We all wanted to sit at 1 table as well instead of being separated (4 of the 11 were children) so we figured we could fit but boy was it a super tight squeeze! I say 9 people is comfortable on their big table, if you go with a party bigger than that be prepared to sit separately. The waiter was pretty attentive and I'm glad he left the pitcher of water close enough for me to grab because I'm one of those people who drink a lot of water and if I wait a long time for it to be filled I start to get annoyed. Parking isn't the greatest. Luckily we went at night when the other businesses are closed but I can image that it's hard to find parking during the day. I'm not positive that I would come to this place again just because of my personal preferences. But if you are hungry and want something that's cheaper/reasonably priced this place is good for you. It wasn't horrible it just wasn't what I was expecting or hoping.\n",
      "The best part of this restaurant is the location. It is at the corner of Yonge and Finch. It is often busy being at the corner of a major intersection with dessert shops and kareoke spots nearby. \r\n",

      "Service: The service here is probably one of the worst service I've experienced at any Korean BBQ restaurants in this area. The guy who served us had absolutely no smile the entire time when my group asked questions. He definitely was having a bad day. He answered everything quickly and he seemed impatient. We felt rushed to order. The server never checked up on our group. Our table was filled with dirty plates causing a lot of space. We were hoping somebody would come and clean some stuff up. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Food: Food was decent. Not great, just okay. I do like the fact they give a wide variety of banchans (side dishes) compared to other BBQ restaurants. My group ordered a variety of meats including pork belly and beef. The BBQ items were typical and just like your average meats from a Kor BBQ restaurant. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In order for me to really like a korean BBQ restaurant is when they have something that stands out. Unfortunately Ssam is pretty typical. Given the fact the service was horrible, this discouraged me from coming back when there are numerous korean BBQ restaurants in this area.\n",
      "2.5 is my rating.\r\n",
      "I would give it a 3, but judging how I was slightly disappointed by my last few visits I'm bumping it down considering the food was just ok at my last visit, and the service was horrible at my prior visit.\r\n",

      "My brother always orders this dish when he comes. This place is known for their aged kimchi which is supposed to be aged for like 20 years or something? I can't say whether it's true or not, but I can say it does taste different and really drenched in flavor. The pork belly is good, the meat is soft and tender. The small is a good portion for one person, comes with rice as well. But is it worth the price? Not so much in my opinion.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "They were however generous with the side dishes. I remember at my last visit about 6 months ago, they only served my table 2 side dishes. When I asked for more and a variety of others just like the table beside me, the waitress came back and said no, you only get specific side dishes based on what you order. Like really? Don't think it would hurt if you offered me more considering you can get free refills for side dishes.\n",

      "This place is horrible! The cashier had an attitude as soon as we walked in and asked our first question. When I asked what something was the cashier rolled her eyes and answered like we were stupid, sorry your food up front doesn't look fresh and was hard to figure out what it was by the looks. Bet if the cashier wasn't so busy doing school work and acting like we are a bother for coming inmore people would feel welcomed.\n",

Boba tea is not something I would recommend, I tried lychee with lychee jelly and it was watery and then I tried the milk tea ( and they has ran out of boba) and offered rainbow jelly and I accepted. Such a horrible suggestion, rainbow jelly is tangy and acid and milk tea is sweet and creamy. It was huge and very expensive :(\n",

      "Everything about this place was horrible.  The food tasted pretty bad.  Every item on the menu was overpriced.  Our total was $50 for 2 egg rolls, a small bowl of soup, 4 disgusting pieces of dim sum, and the worst chicken sandwich I have ever tasted.\r\n",
      "I do not recommend this place to anyone.  They actually served this high priced food on paper plates and bowls with plastic forks.  TERRIBLE.  \r\n",
      "Don't be fooled by the sign that they stick outside their door that says HAPPY HOUR PRICING either.   That only applies to the beer.\r\n",
      "I cannot imagine they get much repeat business!!  I can guarantee you we will not go there again!\n",
      "If it weren't for the horrible service, the food might have gotten 2 stars.  There was a hostess podium outside the restaurant where we waited for 5 minutes, then realized no one was going to host us.  So we walked inside and awkwardly waited for someone to seat us. Again, no one, so we had to stop a server who sat us down.  He said he'd be right with us and never came back to serve us.  A different server came by and took our drink orders, interrupting each order so he could shout it to the drink prep behind the bar.  Three of us ordered food.  One order came out 15 minutes before the other two and he was nearly done eating by the time the other 2 orders came out.  His was a main course by the way and the other two were main dishes and an order of steamed dumplings.  You'd think the steam dumplings would come out first, but whatever.  The food was just OK.  I got the ramen which wasn't the best I've ever had, but clearly something you could probably get from Trader Joe's and heat up at home.  At around $14 per main course, this place was NOT worth the money.  Finally, the poorly-mannered server gave us our bill and stood there and waited while I put down the tip.  I only put about 15% by the way because I was so displeased with the service.  He rudely opened the book to look at the tip in front of us and walked away.  Just tacky.  The service sucks and the food is overpriced. Save your money and go eat elsewhere at the Linq.\n",

      "Everytime I come here I get the pork bone soup. One of the cheapest items on the menu but has loads of pork in a nice large spiced broth. Mind you its messy, but its a staple for me here. I've also tried the tddobokye.  (horrible spelling) its the rice cake and fish cake appetizer. It dressed in a nice red spicy sauce that goes great on your rice. \r\n",

      "I've gone there a bunch of time and the food is good but the customer service is horrible!! They are so rude and even tried to charge us for the side dishes when they're free... very unprofessional, I recommend Nuri Village instead, better food and better customer service.\n",
      "Terrible! A total rip-off!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "First off, the menu is very confusing as it says the lunch special is for 2, yet the menu price is for only 1. We ordered it anyway. It is a very small amount of food for the price. A few thinly sliced pieces of beef and a couple of vegetables. That's it! I've had shabu-shabu many times in my life, and never felt hungry afterwards. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Second, we ordered the king dumplings to fill us up. They were huge, but tasteless. Like eating a lump of newspaper. And there aren't many options for making a sauce to add some flavour to them. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Third, none of the wait staff speaks any English. I realize it is a Korean restaurant, but I didn't realize speaking Korean was mandatory to get service. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Overall a pretty horrible experience. I will NOT be going back.\n",
      "If you wanna stuff your face with meat this is the place to go. I've been here twice for lunch and I don't think I've had a more filling $10 sit down lunch anywhere else. The side dishes are good as well. The service could be a little bit better but I wouldn't classify it as being horrible.\n",
      "I was here with a couple of friends from work for dinner.  I was instructed to come up a set of stairs when I walked into the restaurant.  Once upstairs, I found my friends and sat down.  They were already halfway into dinner service and they let me know that the service was horrible and no one really understood english.  I wasn't going for the All You Can Eat so we asked the waiter for a menu so I could order an item from their dinner menu.  It took them at least ten minutes to bring the menu over and another ten minutes to get my order put through and fill up our cups with water and tea.  The dinner itself, surprisingly, was not too long of a wait and I decided on the Beef Bibimbap, which was very tasty and I demolished the whole thing myself.  While I was eating my dinner, my coworkers were on dessert.  Little did they know that ice cream was not included in AYCE and you have to pay an extra $2 something to order ice cream (which only consisted of chocolate, strawberry, vanilla, green tea and red bean).  Other korean restaurants I've been to for AYCE has always included ice cream and a wide variety of desserts in their dinner service.. None the less, I think I'll stick to my regular korean BBQ restaurants that charge more for AYCE dinner and includes dessert and sushi with better customer service.  Korean Grill House will probably be my last resort for last minute cravings for korean BBQ, the food is delicious don't get me wrong.  They just need to work on including dessert and having more staff in house to serve and cater to good paying customers that are cooking their own food in their restaurant.\n",
      "Been going to this place since 2008 almost every other week, they were the only Korean fried chicken place in DT area and served good chicken. But, since the new owner took over this place 3~4 years ago it's been going down hill fast. Chickens were constantly undercooked or overcooked, never right. I still went because there is no other korean chicken place in the area but only once every month or so. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "However, during my last visit the chicken was so horrible I have simply gave up on this place. Chicken was over fried to a point, it might as well have been chicken jerky and the coating was not standard Booldak style.

If I could give the service zero stars.. I would. The servers would pass by us and pretend she couldn't see us. THEY AUTOGRAT NO MATTER HOW MANY PEOPLE THERE ARE! They do that maybe cause they know they don't give service. They don't prebus so our whole table was full of dirty dishes and they were always frowning and seemed like they hated their job. \r\n",
      "Advice: skip this place and pay a few bucks for better food and better service.\n",
      "I am sorry I am not the type to even give one star but this place is the most rudest place in the world! The service is horrible and the server was so rude and mean! And there's no common sense when they're bringing out the meat for two people and expect us to eat a big plate of food!!!!\n",

      "We had ordered the brisket, pork belly, spicy chicken, beef galbi w/ some steamed egg originally. The portion sizes were pretty big. I don't know if it varies due to party size but for each order, we got a really large amount of brisket, spicy chicken, and beef galbi. Overall, pretty decent quality of meats throughout. Various banchan available including kim chi, potato salad, fish cake. The brisket was good. Not much of a fan of marinated meats but they were ok. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Not a bad place. Only downside is the offerings are quite minimal. Beef tongue is not included in the Vegas Package is a bit saddening. Wish they had beef tongue included as there already isn't much of a selection in terms of non-marinated items. Steamed egg was decent but I feel like its much smaller than those others that offer steamed egg as well. Quite deflated even before getting to the table, which makes it even smaller than it already is. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The ventilation in this place is horrible, if they even work at all. Our hood that spanned the table did not seem to be ventilating anything. Upon entry of the restaurant, you can already tell its pretty bad when there was only 2-3 groups here and it smelled pretty heavily already. Service wise, not bad. They gave us a pitcher of water as well as went around with another to help refill. Fairly decently attentive in terms of ordering and asking if anything is needed. I guess its a bit expected especially since it wasn't busy.\n",

      "Tonight, the service wasnt very friendly. Since the moment we walked in, I felt like we were being rushed. I know you come here, and cook your own food, but should we mop the floors too? Floor was super slippery from the fat splatter, Im assuming. Anyways, my water came out half full, who does that? After placing our order, the waiter grabbed the menu out of my gfs hand. RUDE!!! We got our salad which had slim to no dressing.. Just horrible. Wont be coming back, would have gladly paid extra 6.99 for AYCE Sushi downstairs at Sushi Kaya.\n",
      "I usually go to Tofu Hut, but they were very busy and had a long waiting list. I tried this place a couple weeks ago and felt that they lacked in their customer service. Not only did they keep ignoring our table and walking past us, but whenever they ask if we need anything or if I ask for food, they would forget what we had asked for. While we were waiting for our second order of food, some other lady had come over and just turned the heat off. Once we got our food, we had to ask them to turn the heat back on. Upon getting the receipt, we noticed that a party of 5 or less is 15% gratuity while a party of 6 or more is 18% gratuity. No wonder they have bad service. They get their tip anyway.\r\n",

We had to ask the waitress to refill our water multiple times. Not only that, but one of the waitresses had turned our heat low and when we had gotten our food, it wasn't cooking fast enough. My boyfriend had accident turned the heat off and we just sat there, waiting for a waitress to come over. It took 5+ minutes for a waitress to be seen and she just tried walking past us. When we got her attention, we asked to get the heat started again and she just nodded and went to help another table. We got her attention again she assumed we wanted to change out the grill. She understood once we said it clearly and then walked away. Knowing how their service is, we got up and walked to the front for them to give us our check and to pay. \r\n",

I self diagnosed myself with food poisoning. after that i came back to Korean Gardens and I don't know if its just my horrible experience at the other place but Korean Gardens stepped up their game. not only was the food delicious (we got pork belly and brisket) but the service was unexpectedly great. the last time I was here I had to flag someone down. Now, not only was my server constantly up beat she was very helpful. The highlight is the steamed egg. Oh My Goodness. It is THE most delicious thing in the world. its Soo fluffy and creamy and just eggy heaven. Sometimes I just come here when I'm craving an egg.\n",

So i had high expectations when it came to korean foods. When i moved out here to vegas, all the korean restaurants tasted horrible to me. Except for this restaurant. Korean Garden BBQ is a lot better than other places that i have been too. the banchan is different from other krn restaurants. theres actually something to eat from the banchan. The food is a bit pricey, but it is worth it. If ur looking for really good food in vegas, i would recommend this restaurant.\n",
      "I went here for Christmas Eve with my family and to start off I WILL NEVER GO BACK! I do not recommend this place to anyone please do yourself a favor. The service was absolutely horrible, it was hard to interact with the employees, they took over an hour to bring us our second round of bbq by that time we were just waiting and not hungry. The waiter was rude to top it off. Briskets were really good other than that the meat/chicken was terrible.\n",
      "The fry has always been my goto korean fried chicken place and have ordered chicken from them multiple times, however, my last order experience was horrible at this store location. I ordered half original and half spicy sauce as i looked over their menu, but i realized they gave me both covered in sauce. When i went back to ask them, they said I should have said original FRIED CHICKEN instead of original. Even though the menu right infront of me said original fried chicken, they said I wasn't specific. Please properly train your employees to learn the menu in english.\n",

      "My other friend got the kimchi rice for $10. I didn't get to try it but he said it was really good and devoured it within minutes. Again, the portion doesn't look huge nor worth the price but it still filled him up. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We also tried the fish skewers! It was huge and this is definitely the one dish where I say the portion is so much more than the price! $5 for 3 huge skewers is a steal. It was good but I wish it was in a spicier sauce or something other than just clear broth because it was a little plain. I just dipped it in my rice cake sauce so it was an easy fix! \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oh, lastly we also ordered the dumplings which .. weren't the very best! It was ok but we had better else where and that fact was super evident. It was crispy, I'll give it that but something about the filling we didn't really enjoy. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Service was also very good - our server was very bright, cheerful and adorable! She checked up on us often - not to the point where we were annoyed but enough where we were comfortable and had everything we needed. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I definitely recommend trying Go Topoki if you're in the area or even if you're craving rice cakes! I'll be returning very soon to try out the other sauces. This place is super unique with the customization options for rice cakes, and with superb service - I have really high hopes for this place :)\n",
      "Came here on a Sunday night for dinner with a couple of friends for AYCE KBBQ (seemed like a pretty good idea on a cold winter night).\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To be honest, nothing really stood out for me. We ordered all the meats and veggies - it was all... meh. Not great, not horrible. I wish I had more to say - but unfortunately I just don't.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Service wasn't that great. It wasn't even busy, so I don't really understand why half of the things we asked for never arrived. We had asked for rice and water numerous times, it never arrived. We asked to have our gas refilled, it took them over 10 minutes (my friends were tempted to just go grab a can and change it themselves - cause the table with the gas containers were right next to us).  Then when we asked for more lettuce (there were 5 of us, and so far we only had 4 plates of lettuce), they told us that they will start charging extra for lettuce. I mean, it's an all you can eat place, we ordered a ton of pork belly which they didn't charge for it.\r\n",

      "I don't think we will be going to Nakwon for KBBQ anytime in the future.. so the hunt for a good KBBQ place continues!\n",
      "We came here for a dinner. Food was not too bad, but the service was horrible! There were only two ladies around and they looked impatient. We were basically ignored. There is one help button on the table, but do not bother as no one will come to help, like non-functioning at all. Will never come back again.\n",
      "Okay food... But..... Terrible service, severe understaffed. We pressed service bell, no one came, it wasn't until we continuously pressed for like 10 times, a waitress came. After that, our water ran out, no one came. A waitress passed by, we asked for water, she completely ignore us TWICE. Ask for more side dish, they said they ran out, and they are still dishing them out to new customers... Just horrible... Will never come again even though we live 2 mins away.\n",
      "I love the finch station location more but this One is much closer. Same food menu as finch location but the prices are higher. Looks busy always. I love the food so I go but the service is horrible.\r\n",
      "I went with a friend but my friend didn't wanted to get something as she had already had dinner prior to meeting me but I wanted to come and eat so the waiter takes my order and gives my friend a stare. And says that's all you guys getting with a tone and turned her face and walked away. I was so surprised. I had my food and I won't be going back. Also I paid with cash and the waiter assumed the change is for here and never returned it.\n",
      "The place has the rudest waitresses ever!!! \r\n",
      "Although the food is really good there, but the service is horrible! Will I go there again?... NO. They expect high tips for the poorest service ever, should not be the case at all! \r\n",
      "Side dishes are really small and they told they can be refilled only once, REALLY? \r\n",
      "If you can accept rude attitude and enjoy good food- you might try the place, but if you are used to proper service at the restaurant- you should avoid the place!\n",
      "Extremely Rude Staff!!! My husband and I decided to go here for a date night.  We came in an hour before closing on a Thursday night. This lady came out of the back, gave us a really weird look, looked at her watch, rolled her eyes and told us that the kitchen was closing soon and we need to know what we are getting. We sat down, she didn't say a word to us besides what we wanted to drink and left. The menu seemed really confusing. At that point we decided it was best to get up and leave. we are never going back again!! We had a horrible experience!!\n",
      "Just had a horrible experience here. The host was rude, she had to move other employees stuff off a table to clean it but left the table top dirty, we had to retrieve a cloth to wipe the table ourselves. Waking up to the food line there was stuff sprayed up on the wall the ingredient cards were stuck together and the food line it self was absolutely disgusting. We decided to just leave and go somewhere else. Never again.\n",

      "Very disappointing :(\n",
      "Used to love coming here but horrible service. They messed up on the grill didn't know it was too difficult too but asked for cabbage and got noodles ask to get a new one and I was given 2 options have them pick it out or make a new one. Ultimately I said yeah I'll make a new one less I knew I was getting charged. Had a birthday coupon email says bring in email OR rewards showed both and was not honored. Hopefully things change around here.\n",
      "There is always that one place that no matter how bad the service or how inconvenient the parking situation is, you still keep going back. I think this is that place for me. The food is just that good. The prices vary from cheap to mildly expensive depending on what you get. Now I am not saying the service is horrible, I've had great service here before, but it is hit or miss. Now on to the important part; the foodizzle. Let me start off by saying that you must always order the kimchee soup with what ever you're having. It is hardy, spicy and delicious. By far one of my favourites. Food wise I love me some korean bbq. If your feeling jewy, (yes i said jewy), I highly recommend the L.A. short ribs or the beef bulgogi. If you have time and some cheddar to spend, then I insist on getting their beef short ribs in unique sauce. I do not know what's so unique about the sauce but my lord is it delicious and comes with lettuce to wrap your beef in. They even cut it up and throw it on the table grill for you if you're feeling lazy. Simply delicious. Honorable mention would have to be the chicken katsu don, which is a fried chicken cutlet with a rich sweet and tangy sauce. Yum. Definitely a great place to eat late at night.\n",
      "I can't believe anyone would say it's a good place.  Anyone that says so does not know food at all.  Most horrible Korean food I have ever ate.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Service was the worst ever.  After ordering and waiting for food for 1 hour the waitress came back asking if we ordered.  She had forgotten.  At the end only 1 of 2 tofu soup arrived and we had to leave.\n",
      "This place is horrible i once went here and found metal object in the food like a bolt, the food is not authentic and it poor quality. The guy made me pay for the meal and gave me the wrong change\n",
      "In all fairness, I used to love this place, especially for late nights. it cannot be beat, however, i had a horrible experience here last night. A group of 4 of us came in around 11pm and ordered the late night menu. The staff made a mistake and gave us the wrong order sheet, which included the beef ribs and the sausage (the regular price menu). We did not notice and ordered as per normal. The food was good and the meat was delivered quickly, however about half-way through our meal, a very rude waiter came up to us and asked which menu we had ordered. My friend said the late night menu. At this point, the waiter became very abrupt and proceeded to hastily remove items from our table. I was appalled, as this was their mistake not ours.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At this point we were a little confused, so we referred to the menu, and understood that they had made a mistake and were trying to cover themselves, fair enough, but they could have found a more polite way of telling us, rather than just snatching up things from our table.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After this, the staff became rude an impatient with us. We waited 20 mins after asking them to change our grill. They did so, almost reluctantly. Further to this, we were told, after only being there for 40 mins, that it was last call, even though the restaurant closed at two and others were still ordering. It almost seems like they were mad at us for their mistake.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In closing, decent food, good for late night, service killed it for us and we will not return, plenty of other establishments that can take my money.\n",
      "Great service, I was really surprised as all other Korean Grill Houses I've been to have had horrible service. The food was delicious, prices great for lunch. We arrived hungry and left happy.\n",
      "Bad service made the average korean food horrible. They made us tip for  4 people on the check for horrific service. Never again will I go here. Why did it have 4 stars. Such a lie\n",
      "This place is one of the decent Korean BBQ in town in terms of the food, but service is absolutely horrible. I've been here a few times and usually I am forgiving on the service, because I know its either a hit or a miss. But today I had my most worst experience. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I am going to make this a list so here is the experience.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "- Waited an hour when I was the 2nd one on the sign in sheet,it seem like they didn't have a specific person managing the sheet and had a few groups get seating before anyone on the sheet.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "- While sitting there waiting, there were guest asking about the wait time, but it seems like the workers were unsure and throwing out numbers. If you don't know, don't throw out a number and waste other people's time.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "- Ask for coke and water, only to have them forget, Told them the second time and they finally brought it, but did not bring the cup for the water. Do they expect all of us to drink from that one serving bottle??? Ask for cups afterwards and it seems like the cups were not rinse, you could still smell a strong sense of sanitation water.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "- Ordered 5 different meat to only have them bring it all in one plate, without giving any explanation on which was which, and only had one piece of short rib\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "- Server told us that they were out of tongs and said to use chopsticks instead until the tongs were available. She never brought the tongs so we had to ask another server afterwards which seemed clueless and finally brought us one, but... It look like it was not even wash, there a piece of rice stuck on it and was sticky. Told another server and she brought another one without any apology. But it seems like the previous one that they just wipe off. This was disgusting and had me questioning what other dirty hardware that they gave me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "- Had to ask them to change out my grill and before she did, she turn down the fire which she never turn back up. I had to do it myself\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "- Portion of food were inconsistent, sometimes they gave more and sometimes just a piece.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "- When paying for the bill they charged us for 2 cokes when we only ask for one. Thankfully they took it off.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Overall, they need to have a better organization of the front of the house. That night we had like 5 different workers serve us and most of them didn't seem like they know what they were doing. As of now I would probably never come back to this place unless they get their stuff straight.\n",
      "First off I shall say the food was good. We had the all you can eat and I say it was a good price. The reason why I rated so low was because the service was very disappointing. There was me two other adults and my child. It took forever to order anything and every time we did order they apparently forgot to give us what we requested and we would have to tell them twice before we got anything or flagged down another waitress. \r\n",
      "There was two ladies next to us and my boyfriend asked what food item they were cooking and the guy didn't even know. Luckily we guessed and ordered the right one. And our grill was so smokey I had to scrap it myself and had to keep flagging down someone to change it. Horrible horrible service but food was good. I recommend not to come here if u don't care about somewhat good service unless your really hungry. Can't say much about the food besides being good as if I can do it myself at home.\n",
      "This place is terrible! We went in and they stick is in a booth at the back. It was unbearably hot and stuffy. I looked at the thermostat and it said 89 degrees! That is not acceptable. We told everyone who came to the table that we need to move and they need to turn the ac up. The waiter tells me that its hot because we there are many grills on. That's straight bs! We demanded to be moved and the next table was a bit more cooler than the first. I was too hungry and wasn't leaving til I ate, Hoping the food would make up for it. After we changed tables the service was horrible. I will never go back to that dump!\n",
      "Not even a one star if there is any...... Terrible service and horrible taste of food. Too salty,low quality of meat. \r\n",
      "Never recommend to no one!!!!\r\n",

      "It's dirty,  the vents are horrible, and the meat is also nothing great. The only good thing I can probably say about this place is that the server was very considerate and nice.\n",
      "We came to this place for lunch on Memorial Day at 1:00 and there was one waitress serving around 8 tables by the time we got there. The waitress didn't even acknowledge us when we entered. It took twenty minutes to get us seated, with 2 parties leaving by that time.  She served our water, side dishes, and had our stove set up by the time we spent an HOUR there. By 2:06 pm, we didn't receive our meat at all. Yet as I observed the other tables, other parties had their meat delivered and the last item delivered was our sauces. After trying to satisfy our hunger by eating all the side dishes, we decided we had enough of the wait and wanted to leave. The waitress didn't even try to fix things and just let us go. Way to make us feel like we mattered at all. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This is my first time at a KBBQ with such horrible customer service as this. How is it that it is taking us a FULL HOUR to get us started when the place wasn't even full house? At first we thought it was because there was only a single waitress taking care of the floor, but how she managed to get us started was unnecessarily slow. It didn't make sense why she had to serve us our water and sides at 10 minute intervals and not get our meat and stove started. We went over to another KBBQ place after that and managed to get seated, get our meat, and finish our meal within the next full hour. Compare that. We all thought Hwaro would be great because of the previous yelp reviews but our time was WASTED on this place. We tried to be patient. We really did. That's why we were foolish enough to spend an hour on service that ignored us from the beginning. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I do not recommend going to this place, unless you want to be ignored and treated poorly. 1/2 a star.\n",
      "Horrible food, horrible service!! Charged me double tip, refuse to refund. Never going there again.\n",
      "Poor quality of meat.... Even for a AYCE BBQ\r\n",
      "Smelly... having a rock in the rice is just unacceptable. Willing to speak to the owner how there quality of meat compared to other AYCE bbq places is horrible...\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "No star for here. THe server however was very polite and kind! Only she deserves a star\n",
      "I've been to Hwaro so many times, and every time the service has been excellent. Unfortunately yesterday, May 15th, on my 23rd birthday my family and I decided to dine at Hwaro for my birthday dinner. The service we received was absolutely horrible. Our server, Stephanie, came to our table to greet us and get drink orders, once to take the initial order, and then was never to be seen again. Our table was stacked with dirty dishes, the grill was black and charred, and we had no water the entire time we ate. I got up and flagged someone down and asked one person if they could go get our server and she never came over. I got up a second time and flagged another server down and asked again for her to come over. Finally she came over, took our dessert order because at that point we just wanted to leave, and she never came back again. Overall it was a really really disappointing dining experience and really ruined my birthday dinner.\n",
      "I went to Hwaro for the first time today. I was excited to try the place, and wanted to compare it Gen. I enjoyed the meat, especially the spicy pineapple marinated beef steak. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Yet, I wish I could give them no stars. The service was horrible, the waiter literally threw our meat dishes onto the table. He avoided our table like the plague, so we had to flag him down each time we wanted more meat or side dishes. In his (small) defense the place was busy and he seemed to be the only one working; but that's poor management. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I would not recommend this place based on their poor sevice. Spend your hard earned dollars on a restaurant that actually wants you there.\n",
      "I had high expectations for this place since I've heard good things about it. \r\n",
      "I was greeted by a hostess once I walked in, and was told to wait for them to set up a table. They set up the table with salad and side dishes depending on the number of people you have. Once we saw down, the server introduced herself and asked what we wanted. We placed our order and everything was going well until the meat came out and it was time start cooking and eating. Our server was very busy, since she was assigned to a couple of tables. It was hard to ask to refill our water. Once she did notice we were out of water, she took the bottle but never replaced it with a new one. Since she had way too many tables to cook the meat for, she cranked up the gas when she cooked our meat. The flames were high and the meat was being cooked with the flames going right through it. The meat tasted horrible! It tasted straight up gas and it was so bitter! I know that the server is in a rush to get the meat cooked... but it made it taste sooooo bad! I had to force it down my throats since the food was so expensive! We tried telling the server that we will cook it ourselves, which she said okay to. But she later would come back and take over and scolded us for taking over. \r\n",
      "I think what would have made the experience better would be if the server asked us how well done we liked our meat. We prefer medium to medium well for beef, but she made everything well done. I took a piece of meat when she hopped onto another table to cook for them for a couple of seconds and it was soooooo delicious because it was cooked medium. The meat melted in my mouth and was so tender and flavorful. I tried moving the meat to the side so it wouldn't become well done and taste like gas... but when the server came back, she gave me a stern look and clamped the meat back to the center. She continued having the flames go through the meat and cook it well done. They tasted horrible after being burned for so long. \r\n",
      "What would have also made the experience better is if the restaurant or server offers to let us cook our meat ourselves. This way, the customers can have the meat the way they want it. If not, then at least please try to ask the customers how they like their meat cooked and not to scorn at customers.\n",
      "The restaurant has a great atmosphere. However, the service was horrible and the food lacked fundamentals to traditional Korean BBQ. \r\n",
      "1. Korean BBQ aka beef and LEAF typically has lettuce to wrap up the meat and the fixings. In this instance you're told to just eat the cut up meat. It takes away from the authentic experience. \r\n",
      "2. The service was horrible. Maybe we were just one of the unlucky ones. We had the waitress with the Monroe piercing, and she had the worst attitude throughout our lunch. I'm not even someone that expects over the top service, but the combination of her attitude and lack of service is the reason I'll never return. It took her 15 minutes to even come by and take our order. She never bothered to refill our water even when asked. We were halfway done with our meat before our rice finally got to our table. Rule #1 Never go somewhere your business isn't wanted. \r\n",
      "3. It's a shame the service was so bad because the food was pretty good. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Place has great potential, but there are some things that need to fixed. I'd recommend addressing the bad customer service and add leafs to the beef and leaf experience. Food was really tasty and the place had a great atmosphere.\n",
      "The food isn't that great. More importantly, horrible service by a waiter there. Very unprofessional and rude. I had complained about their service and the bill had a wrong item in it.. and the guy doesn't even apologizes when asked to correct. I will never go to this restaurant again.\n",
      "Such a horrible service, and really small portions. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Its the first time and absolutely the last time i come here cause I was so disapointed. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "- seriously, I dont highly recomment u guys come here!!\n",
      "Tastes ok, but portions are tiny and service is horrible. We got cold stares when we walked in at 9:20. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was a mix-up in the order and one dish came out less. We were served 3 entrees (party of 4). We were told that they are not going to start cooking one entree again.  I always assumed, if you are a restaurant, that is what you do. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We were hungry are drive from NJ so we ate and cut our losses. IMO, 3 dollars for a bowl of rice is a bit much. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thank you but no Thanks.\n",
      "Doesn't matter if the food is good if the service is horrible.  They have people waiting to be seated but they don't acknowledge the customers.  I guess they do not care about customers, 2 groups left after waiting 15 min without anyone greeting them, walk by as if the customers are invisible.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Don't waste your money and time at this place, go across the street to Tofu Hut, much better service.\n",
      "When greeting wasn't even no smile. Food selection on the menu sucks. Gen and Master's Kim's Korean bbq has more better option and gives better service. Water was sitting empty and should be checked on each table to see there's any left for customers to drink. Ladies restroom smells horrible like it hasn't been clean with any cleaning products. Won't be coming back here ever again.\n",
      "horrible service! staff just talking to each other while customer calling them for help. waited 20 minutes for soup only to be served cold! now i know why there's no long cue at this restaurant because of the very very very bad service!  not coming back again! i'd rather wait for an 1 hour or 2 at hwaro than to eat here at hanu!!!! very disappointed!\n",
      "Completely horrible service waited 20 minutes to be seated once we were seated no one ever came to our table after another 20 minutes guy was doing construction on the booth next to us during dinner hour there were 5 other empty booths  available but the girl told me they were for bigger parties even though I could see other parties of 3  or 4 seated in all of the other booths this is our 2nd experience with completely horrible service at this restaurant\n",
      "Hanu has great food options, but when my friends and I went, the services was horrible, they never came by to clean / take the dishes off our table, we told them multiple times, gave us attitude, just horrible service, want to go back again, probably different hour so we don't have to deal with the night crew. Willing to give this place and their service one last chance.\n",
      "Went here tonight with my boyfriend and brother. Food is good, prices are good but the service is horrible. We had one waitress take our order and we waited god knows how long to order again. The whole staff was just gathered at the front socializing. I would love to add that it was not even close to busy! I've gone to other korean bbq places who do a fantastic job just checking up on the tables routinely, like clockwork and they were busier than this place. \r\n",
      "Back to my essay, finally one waiter named JR came by to see how we were doing because he saw me keep looking for someone to order more food. \r\n",
      "Thank you JR for helping us out even though we weren't your assigned table. Was really wanting to talk to a manager about the experience, but not even worth it. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This is the 3rd time I've had a bad experience at this place with the service. The first time was when they opened, understandably, i get that it was brand new so it was a little hectic. But it wasn't over the top crazy. People were receiving their orders much faster than when we had ordered. And of course, we waited longer. Turns out, they forgot to put our orders in. Second time, i came in with a family of 5. They charged us for a family of 6, kind of sneaky for them to put that sweet, extra charge especially when you can clearly see that there's been 5 of us that's been dining in there for an hour. Thank god, I checked the receipt before paying. So for future reference, keep a look out for any extra charges they wanna put on your bill. \r\n",

      "I bought one thing from them. After I got the food, it looked so different, and then I took a bite. It tasted so bad. Then, I complained to the manager. The manager refused to return or exchanged the food for me. What's worse is that he refused to admit their food is different from the picture and even insulted me. I will never buy anything from this place and this brand.\n",
      "They must changed the cook because everything here tastes horrible. I ordered my usual Jap chae(clear noodle) and tteobokki(spicy ricecake), and they just tasted different from the one I had before. Everything is super salty. Probably won't come back here anymore.\n",
      "My friends and I came during the lunar New year celebration, so it was a bit busy. And that probably accounts for the tables not being kept clean, and the service being bad. So I feel as though this review might not be too fair because of that. They have little buttons on the table you can use to call for service, but after our drinks went empty and multiple button pushes, we didn't get water till we saw the server rush by.\r\n",

      "Service was bad, but the food came out fast. I also feel as though my review might not be fair because the food isn't really to my taste. I got dumplings and a hotpot and they tasted bad. The hot pot was really bland, the dumplings had a bit too much going on and didn't hold their shape. I had to take the hotpot home to my boyfriend because I literally couldn't eat it I just didn't like it that much. \r\n",

After a gaze at the menu, I asked our server who hardly spoke English about ingredients in the berries almond a챌ai bowl. Apparently sweetened with stevia. He said no it was sweetened with dates and didn't know what stevia is. I asked another waiter and she said it didn't have any dates and was sweeten with sugar. They weren't able to answer any of my sons questions about the menu either. The people sitting next to us noticed our frustration and said they just went through the same thing as well. \r\n",

      "The food is good, but the service is horrible. I wouldn't recommend going here for Korean BBQ. It is far more expensive and you get only a few side dishes. My boyfriend and I went here for lunch and and were not given any rice or soup with our Korean BBQ. For the price you pay, you would expect a lot more side dishes and they don't provide any extra meat.  I had requested for a couple of slices of meat and the waitress was extremely upset about the request and stated that I had to pay extra. I would highly recommend checking out another restaurant. I too had read the negative reviews and thought I would still give this restaurant a shot, I wished I had took those posting more seriously and checked out a different restaurant.\n",
      "This gets zero stars from me. Don't get me wrong, the food is great but the service is horrible on this particular visit. The waiter from last time was a 5 star waiter and this time I was stuck with a lousy waiter who was too busy making friends with a larger group and gave my family and I an attitude even after speaking with the manager. I'm never one to complain as I understand waiters can be busy but unfortunately, the manager didn't even help solve anything. The waiter continued to serve us with the shittiest attitude and kept avoiding our table after confronting his manager. After this experience it will be a while for me to return to this business if they keep hiring waiters like the one that i got today\n",

      "I personally ate the beef brisket, which I cooked well done, not hard to do since so thinly sliced, and the calamari which was well cooked as it shriveled up and became rubbery and didn't taste that good, as well as their potatoe salad which i ate a lot of and soondoboo which I had a couple of spoon fills because it just didn't taste right and was too oily. Between one of those four items, I got some horrible food poisoning. This was the only food I had eaten that day as we went for a late lunch and around 2am I woke up with horrible stomach pains and was throwing up like crazy. 2 days later I am still sick with food poisoning. Will never be coming back here again.\n",

      "When we walked in we were informed it would be about a 20 minute wait so we asked if we could head to the bar, which we did. We had a difficult time choosing a drink because they were out of everything we wanted! They didn't have Kirin and the only local beer was Four Peaks Kiltlifter. We asked for their featured drink (something Martinez) and the bartender informed us they have never been able to make it and he didn't know why it was on the menu. The condition of the bar was atrocious as well. Boxes of beer stacked in plain view in the bar, most of them damaged because of a wet floor. Dirty glasses and coffee cups on the bar. AND the liquours all had saran wrap around the spouts, implying they have an issue with fruit flies. We decided to continue with the lunch because we know they are new and we wanted to try it and give them the benefit of the doubt.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After about five minutes, we received a text notification that the table was ready. We grab our drinks and walk to the front, where the hostess politely informs us the table isn't actually ready. So we walk back to the bar, drinks still in our hands and sit down again. The hostess is there almost instantly to say our table is ready. A lot of back and forth for nothing; they need to get organized!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We sit down and tell our waitress (when she asks) it's our first time. We were informed we had to order the dinner menu (at dinner price) and that any left over food would constitute an additional $5/plate upcharge!!!! She also told us we could only order 4 items at a time. All of this information is important, but we still didn't know how to eat a Korean BBQ and we received NO instruction! We asked a couple other people who worked there, and they all seemed clueless and unable to provide instruction. The food was amazing. The marinades and meats were amazing; if you love meat, you need to try Korean BBQ (just not here!) No one explained the sides or how to compliment the meats with them, so we felt like we missed out on the full experience. We also received no instruction on how long to cook the meats or seafood which seemed odd.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lastly, the worst experience of them all came when we paid. For two of us, it was a $75 tab. My friend put down half in cash, I was paying the other half on my card. Suddenly, my card was charged $190!!!!!! After finally flagging someone down after a good 5 minutes to say I wanted to talk to someone about the charge, the waitress comes over to confirm that my card was mischarged, the manager was fixing it and that she would be by in a minute. She still did not come by after several minutes so I went to her at the front cash register. She had several receipts and it was very obvious there was confusion on how to fix the error. She did not speak to me at all, she let her hostess at her side do the talking. The hostess said they had credited my card $190-$38 which was approximately $152 and then they handed me $38 cash and were about to swipe my card for the entire tab of $75!!!! At this point, I said no way and took my card back and said they shouldn't have handed me the $38 cash and that it was theirs to cover my bill. Now, they said I owed them an additional $3 (I'm not sure how and I should have asked at the time) but I was so unwilling to hand my card back, that my friend dug in her purse for the money. At this point, I was frank with them and said that I thought it was BS that they charged my card incorrectly, did a poor job fixing it and then were being petty over the $3!!!!! She didn't apologize, she didn't say I was right, she didn't backtrack on the request. Her manager never looked at me or spoke to me or apologized. No one tried to fix this!!!!!! We walked away very upset.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I called my bank yesterday when I didn't see any changes in the charge. My bank confirmed that at the very least, they should see some activity on their end of a debit/credit and there was none so I had to dispute the charge to make sure I get my money back.  If you decide to go, you'll have a wonderful meal but hopefully you'll know how to cook it and get the full benefit of the meal and cooking. Take cash!!!!!!!!!!!\n",
      "This is not a authentic Korean restaurant the banchan is Korean side dish  koreans are known for, this place had the worst i ever had  the meats are terrible the  pork bulgogi was awful the service was horrible too the waitress kept forgetting our order i had to remind her several times  i am a 1st generation Korean i grew up in San Francisco  where the Korean food is real i dont expect California quality in Korean food here  in AZ but gen was the worst i had in AZ not worth $25 per person for dinner\n",
      "A nice place for a fun dinner. Not quiet, so don't come here for a meeting. Ventilation is horrible as smoke builds up at your table. Been to Korean bbq places in NY and each table had a vent, sucking smoke. We left the place smelling like bbq. \r\n",

      "I don't like the fact that it's not a buffet style where you get your own food and start cooking, not sure if it's an AZ health code thing or what, as it is my first time in az at a Korean bbq. Servers will bring only 4 items at a time, you pay flat $25 for all you can eat, but service is slow and by our third round we were tired of waiting. I don't know if I'd try it again, it was an OK experience but will have to go to another Korean bbq when I go to NYC\n",

      "The Tempe location needs better training. We had Donna as our server. She was horrible. She didn't light our grill so we had to flag down another server to light it. The meat came out before the grill was lit. Everything else took forever and she kept forgetting items we asked for. We had to ask for items 3 or 4 times or ask other servers walking by. We put in meat orders and they kept getting lost. We sat for at least 10 minutes without meat. We also ordered pork belly 2 times and never got it. Only when we requested it a third time did she finally bring it. She asked if we had ordered it from someone else and she made the excuse that she had 8 tables to serve. That's not my problem. Talk to your manager if you can't handle all your tables. We originally had a party of 10 but they couldn't seat us together so they split us into two tables. There were five per table but still charged 18 percent tip. 18 percent starts at 6 people. \r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "The quality of the food here is horrible. The beef looks like something that came out of a toilet. Very tough and chewy, the lowest quality beef I have ever had. Chicken was bad, beef was horrible, the only thing acceptable was the pork belly. I have no idea how this place has 4 star avg. but I would not come here again even if it was free. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "If you do come here, read the bottom of the menu.. it's insane. In short it says: they are watching you on camera and if you attempt to dispose of any in eaten food you will be charged. What a poor business model \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ultimately this is a novelty restaurant with the lowest quality meat imaginable. Really bad. Full disclosure I have never written a review on yelp.. it was that bad.\n",
      "My first visit was excellent, the three times I went after that were horrible. Service was just horrible. Our waiter greeted us, and the only time she ever checked in on us was to give us our bill. The last visit I made made it official that I will not be returning. Our waiter greeted us, and brought us our beverages and then never came back. We had to flag someone down to put in another order, and each time it was a different person. We asked for a refill, and the waitress was happy to take it back but she never brought our beverage back, we had to stop another waiter 15-20 minutes later to ask for another beverage. Our grill was never changed the entire hour we spent there. Some of our food selections weren't even brought out, but we just paid and left because apparently they were too busy on a Tuesday at noon. I'm sure we will run across another kbbq spot in the valley.\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Only downside to the place is the service isn't amazing. The busboys are on point, but the waiters are okay. Me and the boys are always breaking our necks trying to find a waiter and they're all running around like chickens without a head. They probably need more staff on the floor. And the brisket always takes a while to come out for whatever reason.\r\n",

      "The service was horrible, qui did not check up on us as often as he should have. I had to physically get up and ask the bartender for a refill. We were supposed to receive sides automatically but we had to ask them to bring them out for us, one of those sides was rice, we asked for it and they said they ran out and asked us to wait 10 minutes... so we did, in fact we waited for 30 minutes... So when it came down to pay qui charged my card TWICE and now I have to wait 3-5 business days for my money to be refunded! The only reason I knew he had charged my card was because I checked my banking app. Qui did not apologize for the horrible service. I asked to talk to the manager and she didnt do much either. It was the worst customer service I have ever experienced.\n",
      "My son wanted to celebrate his 22nd birthday at Gen Korean BBQ House and I have to say.... it was not a pleasant experience. From the moment we walked in you needed a fly swatter to keep the flys off of you. The wait was not bad for a Sunday at 4pm. As they walked us to our table you could sense mad chaos within the staff. After getting seated I needed to wash my hands from sitting with all of the flys and swatting them for 15 mins. The bathrooms are near the kitchen and the smell and the grime on the floor were absolutely horrible. I finally got back to my family at the table and was greeted by our server. The server seemed like we were upsetting her by dining at the restaurant. She had the worse attitude and made the experience that much worse. We rode it out and tried to enjoy the experience. We ordered some cocktails which took over 15 mins to get and I had to inform the waitress that our drink was sitting at the bar. I ordered a rum and coke and received a full glass of coke and my rum separately in a small glass and was charged for something completely different. We talked to another server and he explained to us that they have extreme turnover with waitresses.  I could go on and on with this horrible experience that I wasted over $240 on. Won't go again!\n",
      "Horrible horrible place , first things first , we came here at 12:30 typical lunch time , we ordered the gal bi soup , took 45 mins to come out ! What the hell ! They said it was because they ran out of broth , wtf ? Ok whatever .. Finally comes out soup is all salty and the rice was moosh ! We did not wait almost an hour for this .\n",
      "well been here a few times over the last few years, this last visit was the one that I had to write on.  So sad that the food quality has gone down.  We had the Mahn Doo Gook (Dumpling Soup), was not as tasty as it was in the past, especially since this is my FAV for Korean soup (childhood fav).  They seemed to add sesame seeds to almost everything, which I thought took away from the flavor versus adding, especially to my Mahn Doo Gook.  Ok, onto the Kahl Bee (BBQ Short Ribs), LA style, so no long cut, did not BBQ at the table as the all-you-can-eat was for everyone or no one.  Since we had kids that are kinda picky, this would not work out well, and also didn't want my toddler going for the flames!  OUCH!  Should of checked yelp for other restaurants in the area prior to coming here.  My parents were in charge of finding places to eat that are Korean, since my dad MUST have his Korean food at least 2x while traveling.  Server should of brought out kid friendly utensils (plastic smaller version) versus the adult size stuff.  Had to go and ask for this 2x as she only brought out one set after asking initially.  Also had to go and get my own napkins.  REALLY!  My own napkins!  Ultimately the 2 stars is for its not horrible, but better places out there for better $ and better service, time to find new restaurants next time I am in Vegas.\n",
      "So, I kinda feel bad that I didn't try any of the tofu soups here, since that is their specialty, but I was craving bibimbap so bad, so that's what I got. I was kind of bummed that it Just didn't hit the spot for me (Insert emoji crying face) It had too much rice, which did not get crispy on the bottom of the bowl (which is normally the best part!) and was missing that good savory/sweet Korean bbq flavor on the meat. One thing I was happy with was that it came with a raw egg. Normally the bowl is so hot it quickly cooks the egg as you mix it all together. Since the bowl wasn't hot enough to crisp the rice, it took a little bit longer than usual to cook up the egg. With all that said, it wasn't horrible or anything, it just was t the bibimbap I was looking for. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I would love to go back though, and try the tofu soups, as I mentioned, that is more their specialty. The service was great, and it's very clean and cute inside. Prices were good too and they have a nice selection of Korean beers. Next time I'm in town, I may try it again if I happen to be in the area.\n",
      "I went here for dinner... wasn't too impressed. The service was horrible, it took 10 minutes just for us to get water.. and for being a Korean restaurant, they don't even have barley tea..which woahhh..whattt...pretty sure a Korean restaurant should have that? Anyways.. the food wasn't even that great, I know so many people who love this place..but come on, really? Hidori tops this place by a long shot..even Takamatsu. The sides they provided weren't even that fresh, perhaps I came in on an off day....what even pisses me off more is that a server blatantly ignored a husband and his wife that was waiting for 15 minutes for a server (okay seriously, that is really REALLY rude, especially when you look at them and roll your eyes..whoever you are nameless server). \r\n",

I try to come here as often as I can.\n",

      "We went here last night for the first time.  It is true that the exterior of the building is a tiny bit shady but it's not as bad as I thought.  I think the problem is horrible lighting since there aren't many building around that area.  The place is really clean and and welcoming.  The servers were nice and the food was way better than Hodori...both in Mesa and L.A.  We are totally glad that we tried this place and will be regulars from now on.   \r\n",

      "After looking at their menu and hearing from others how great this place is, my husband and I decided to try it for lunch. When we walked in we were greeted immediately and seated in the \"party section\" in the back. They were very busy so this didn't bother us at all; we were just happy to get a seat that fast. We looked at the menu and our waiter was taking our order in less than 2 minutes. I ordered the Bulgogi Lunch Box and my husband ordered the rice dish with Bulgogi and a fried egg on top (I don't remember exactly what it was called). We received our miso soup and then our little side dishes of kimchi, radish, etc. very quickly. The food was great. The soup was served hot, with the little tofu pieces, and the side dishes were exactly what we expected. When I received my lunch box I was impressed because it looked and smelled amazing. My husband received his food about 3-4 minutes later. Because we didn't receive our food at the same time, we never got a check to go pay (we had to relay what we ordered to the cashier at the front), and also because the women next to us ordered some soup that smelled so bad (like hot blue cheese) that it was VERY hard to continue to eat our lunch without getting sick; I've decided to give them 4 stars instead of 5. The service and food was great so we will return, and I do highly recommend I Love Korea for great food for a great price. Hopefully when we do return no one will order that horrible soup again. Yuck!\n",
      "I ordered Salmon Teriyaki £13.50 and all that I had was 1 piece of realy thin salmon ridicously greasy with at leats 150g of beansprouts???\n",
      "\n",
      "My friend has noodles with no sauce and with 3 pieces of greasy chicken for £11.50\n",

      "absolutely horrible!!\n",

      "Do not order take away\n",
      "I'm sorry but this is literally the worst sushi I've ever had in my entire life! If you can't do it, better not to put it on the menu. All the rolls are so loose that I can't even pick up by chopsticks, avocado was so unripe, very hard and taste horrible!\n",
      "\n",
      "Friend had the hot pot soup with seafood, she says not very fresh seafood and too salty.\n",
      "The shop looks a little shady. Initially we were not sure about it, but since there was nothing more alluring in the vicinity, we decided to go for it. To our surprise, it was really good. The korean fried rice was really good and spicy enough (for asians who love extra spiciness). Had another dish with 4 types of meat (can't remember what the dish is called) but it was really tasty as well. The meats were well-marinated.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only thing I really hate about it is the horrible lighting, it was difficult to eat in the extremely orange lights. Aside from that, I'd totally recommend it! :)\n",
      "i gave this place a try as the other Korean restaurant 'Toppokki' across the road in china town seemed too busy. The food was absolute garbage from the frozen breaded prawn starters to a kimchi stew which tasted hideous, I felt like i could taste tomato ketchup in the soup. The service was pretty appalling, had to go out of my way to get the attention of the waitress who was frowning the entire evening. No authenticity, horrible tasteless bland food which is nothing like Korean home cooked food, poor service. If only I could give zero ratings.\n",
      "For your own sake, please DO NOT GO ANYMORE OR AT ALL!!!!!\n",
      "I wish there's NEGATIVE rating here! This is place is horrible! Not kids friendly, not customer friendly! My husband, me and our kids (3 of them) came for lunch. My kids are not very quite, but well behaved. But the guy (I think he's the owner) said I should watch my kids, how rude! And we wanted to order sushi roll, he said he can't make it. So we ordered 2 lunch specials and 1 hot soup, but he says lunch special is very small, then I asked him how small, then he started to give us very bad attitude! So my husband said let's go to a different place, then he said if you come next time I will call the police! This place is totally a JOKE!!!!\n",
      "The waiter of this restaurant was extremely ARROGANT and went totally psycho when two of us asked whether we could sit at a table of 4 when there is only one table taken by two guests in the entire restaurant with about 10 tables total. He owner said IT WAS THEIR LUNCH TIME and they did not want 2 guests to sit at a table of 4. I asked then why the other two guests were sitting at a table of four. he said because they were Americans. At that moment my friend and I just wanted to get food and leave but his rudeness was not done yet. When we ordered and asked about lunch special, the owner said NO, IT IS NOT LUNCH TIME! Then I asked:\"When is your lunch time then?\" He got pissed and asked us to leave. OMG! This is horrible.\n",
      "\n",
      "I promised we were not being arrogant or anything. At the beginning I was thinking his rudeness might be a result of his limited English, as an immigration I should have more patience and sympathy. But no, i was wrong. He was rude and the reason he refused us what he served with the two white Americans was because we are not white.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although I did not have the chance to dine here, I got a chance to glance at their menu. It was pricy compared to many other Korean restaurants in this area. And they don't have many typical Korean dishes on their menu. So it might be a good thing we were driven out of this place.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was my first time ever to write a review about anything online. I just feel there are so many hard working restaurant owners and waiter/waitresses to be supported and this kind of people should run out of business if they are not changing their attitude.\n",
      "\n",
      "Avoid this restaurant.\n",
      "We heard that this would be a good place to eat because of the food but we sorely regretted coming here because of the horrible service. After we sat down, our waitress was rude and had attitude with us, likely because she did not speak much English. She even gave us looks while we were ordering because she had a difficult time understanding. Because she had a difficult time understanding, she placed the wrong order without even checking with us and then telling us that we can't change it because it has already been placed. After that, she did not try to check in with us and another server had to help us with the food. We never saw the waitress again during our meal. The table next to us were also tourists and we could tell they had some confusion with what they ordered and their waiter was impatient with them and rudely asked a server to deal with them. I would think because this location is in a tourist district that they would cater to tourists but they really fail with that. It seems to be always busy despite the poor service, probably because of its prime location. Will not be visiting again or recommending it to others. The food was okay despite not what we wanted to order.\n",
      "This is not a nice restaurant. Their Ventilation system doesn't work . All the oily and Pungent smell make me and my friends sneeze nonstop. And because all the sneezing I can't even taste their food properly. They have the very worst service I've ever experienced in Seoul. Their horrible attitude and bad service that left me feeling like we couldn't leave there fast enough.\n",
      "My friends and I visited this place twice. The first time round, the service was horrible. The waiter was extremely rude, snatching away the spatula my friend was holding. No explanation was given with regards to how to cook the food; they simply just do it without telling us that they are supposed to do it. On top of that, we had to order one portion per person. Like what is that supposed to mean? So we visited another time just to give them a second chance at redemption but they seem to be very good at providing the exact same service we had the first time. My friend had a baby she was attempting to console at the time, we were all hungry and cold because it was winter and there you go, this waiter were rudely gestured towards her, her baby and her husband to leave the restaurant so that the other customers would eat in peace. We have already ordered for 6 people and the portion can be very large. Quite unfortunately, the waiter then told us we cannot cancel. We were all very irritated at this point in time. My two friends and their baby left earlier so we were forced to eat the large portion. We did a takeaway in the end but obviously, the quality of the food would not be there. In the end, we threw wasted food away.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only saving grace? Probably just the food.\n",
      "We visited the PyongYang restaurant with the idea of getting some new taste experiences given that North Korea is not really a place easily visited. We walked away with a very disappointed feeling and a huge bill.\n",
      "\n",
      "The inside of the restaurant - at lunch - was empty and looks like a large dining hall for a 500+ seat wedding rather than a restaurant. So we were shuffled in some side cubicles i.e. a table in between some wooden screens. I saw some pictures here of waitresses in traditional dress, they were no where in sight at lunch either.\n",
      "\n",
      "We had a South Korean in our party so I guess it is fair to say that the taste bud judgement can be labelled as accurate. Me myself I am also a experienced Korean foodie but not native.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cold noodles, deemed to be a specialty of North Korea were tasteless.\n",
      "On the other hand the dumplings and kimchi were excellent (note that kimchi needs to be purchased, doesn't come as normal addition like in other Korean restaurants).\n",
      "\n",
      "We had fried seasoned pork. Somewhat ok, but not fried at the table, wich means it gets cold pretty quickly (including the fat) and the side disches such as garlic and onion cannot be fried or warmed up either. So basically chewing raw onion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then came the big surprise / disappointment. We ordered a mixed sachimi of ... 30 USD !!! Yes, you read correctly. 30 USD is basically the price of a complete meal in other restaurants in Siem Reap. So the expectation level was at least to have a decent sachimi. But low and behold, what came out was slices of completely frozen fish, still frozen on the plate.\n",
      "Tasteless and horrible texture to start with (who likes to eat ice?) and when they started to thaw, the water started dripping out to make the experience even more unpleasant if at all possible.\n",
      "We complained to the waitress that this was not even near an acceptable sachimi and asked to return.\n",
      "Which was refused, \"Siem Reap is far from the sea so this is what you get\" was the answer.\n",
      "Although, obviously, Siem Reap has enough water around, Tonle Sap lake and all to provide for some decent fresh fish.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the end, we had to pay 80 USD for the lunch, which is an outrageous amount for Siem Reap. That price level would need to guarantee the visitor some fine dining at least.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alas, North Korea thinks differently. I hope the regime enjoys our dollars.\n",
      "\n",
      "A dining place to be avoided is the only possible conclusion.\n",
      "We have chosen this restaurant after reading reviews in tripadvisor but the food was very disappointing. In fact, it was the worst korean food I have tried. Service was not good at all and we didn't feel welcomed. Food was very salty and greasy. Kimchi was not fresh and very sour. It was horrible. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone\n",
      "I’m usually pretty forgiving when it comes to horrible service and bad food, but this place is an embarrassment. Once we were seated we were rudely told we had to finish our meal by 8:00 to free up the table, when our good finally arrived, they forgot one order that came out 15 minutes later, all were tasteless and cold. What a total waste.\n",
      "So we drove by this place and saw that there was a wait. Being the Asian I am, wait equals good food plus from the quick drive-by, the place looked just like one of my favorite Korean BBQ places in NYC. Not knowing that indeed the place was a chain of the NYC Kang Ho Dong but with a new name \"Sura Hawaii\" and no longer part of the chain, we were extremely disappointed with the food. The NYC chain is so much better. Not sure if this is because they are no longer part of the chain. The side dishes were horrible. The pancakes that came were cold, hard and oily. The special sauce was nothing like the Kang Ho Dong sauce. The scallion and bean sprout accompaniment barely had any bean sprouts. The beef tongue we ordered was too thick and the prime short rib was definitely not quality beef. I don't have anything to compare to since it changed names in Hawaii but the standard is not there for us.\n",
      "\n",
      "And just a couple words about Korean BBQ service. Usually at Kang Ho Dong, the service is much better. We had to BBQ the meat ourselves and some of our meet burned. We flipped the egg ourselves as well. Maybe we are just spoiled by the NYC full service.\n",
      "This place sadly, does no justice to the amazing Korean cuisine. Most of the dishes that we ordered, as a group of four, tasted largely of Sriracha sauce. None were horrible, and one spicy beef dish was actually quite good. Something with octopus was overcooked, making it quite rubbery. Banchan, the traditional little apps shared by all at the table, were likewise not great, but also not terrible. While one doesn't need to go as far as Korea for excellent Korean, with Toronto providing plenty of inexpensive, yet delicious options, Ottawa is once again lacking.\n",
      "A friend and I decided to pop in here to eat one evening around 4pm. I had heard that the food was really great and that it was a must try. We were seated promptly even though the restaurant looked extremely busy. It took about 10 mins for a waitress to take out orders. Seeing that it was my first time having Korean food, I had a few questions to ask about the dishes I had chosen and she was quite nice in answering my questions. We had also ordered some beverages. I also appreciated the fact that she even told us that the food may take a while due to how busy they were that evening. Another 10 mins passed and we still hadn't received our drinks. We sat and watched people come in, sit, eat and leave. I assumed that some of these ppl were probably \"regulars\" who would pre-order and make reservations so I didn't say anything. 10 mins turned in to 45 mins and still no drinks or appetizers. At this point I was becoming furious because there were 2 waiters on the floor that would pass around to ensure that tables in the vicinity of our table were fine but for some odd reason, they would not check our table. At this point I looked up to see about 5 of Alirang's employers standing near the bar area looking at us and all whispering to each other. Based on the fact that I had not seen the waitress that had taken our order and the confused looks on their faces was a big enough hint that our order had most probably been misplaced. I sat there waiting to see what they would have done. I had decided that the food probably wasn't worth such horrible service. Furthermore, they dealt with the situation in such poor taste. Maybe it's a cultural thing when it comes to service... who knows... so as we were getting up to leave, another waitress approaches us with a menu in hand asking us if we had ordered. I told her that we had and that we never saw the waitress that tool our order. At this point I didn't even want to stick around so I told her not to bother and we left. I'm sure they have great food but if you cannot display good customer service then I cannot spend my money at your restaurant.\n",
      "We went there with my friends on a friday night. We all like Korean, but we all agreed that the food was not as good as in other korean restaurants, even the fast food-style places on the same street.\n",
      "The service was horrible. We all speak multiple languages and are used to speaking to people from all over the world, yet we were literally not able to order an extra side of rice. The waitress seemed very disinterested and we did not feel welcome at all.\n",
      "We ate at this place while in New York. I was very impress how quick our food was served but then just to realize ---- the faster they served your food the faster they want you out. The lines were really long as people were waiting. We order the Korean BBQ, the waiter ruined our experience of table cooking. She literally cooked it for us! She was super rude, she snatched the chopstick from my niece hand! Food was okay, ive had better Korean food. Our bill came up to $100 and as we paid at the counter the old lady ( I don’t know if shes the owner ) asked if we left a tip we said YES but she didn’t believe us so she called the waiter on their walkie talkie. We gave a $5 tip because the service we got was HORRIBLE! She demanded a $14 tip from us. Who the hell does that? Our experience was horrible and we will never eat here again! She would not give back my boyfriend credit card until he put a $14 tip!\n",
      "We went in In a happy emotion but turned out that they did Chinese food and the egg thingy was horrible and the service was horrible\n",
      "Service horrible. Never will go again. The old location was much better. Food and services! !!! At least the waitress are not hovering over you, so that you can't eat. Very rud!!! Very pricey!!! Very disappointed! !!! This restaurant was one place I liked in the city, but not anymore!!!\n",
      "This place is for tourists that have been here and rated it high. Found it here at trip advisor with high ratings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Drinks: we had negronis, probably the easiest drink to blend with 3 ingredients. Too much gin, to much ice and a slice of orange. Such a fail.\n",
      "\n",
      "Food: for starters we had the octopus salad and sausage meatballs, not bad but nothing special.\n",
      "Food: main course we had the fish and prawn risotto, was okay but again nothing special. The grilled cod with potatoes was horrible. The cod was over grilled, and was hard to eat. It was served with potatoes, spinach and black olives. Very bad combination.\n",
      "We skipped dessert as the food was bad.\n",
      "\n",
      "The service was also poor, the waiter couldn’t recommend a nice wine to pair with the cod. He was also very slow, looked tired and uninterested.\n",
      "A bit overpriced for this experience.\n",
      "You’ll find much better food in Lisbon.\n",
      "Love. Korean food, we ate there just once but what we had was bland and more like something you would get if you had no idea what Korean food was like and tried making some with whatever you had handy in the cupboard but had no imagination and were a horrible cook.\n",
      "If you are looking for authentic, delicious Korean food, you have to try this restaurant!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "On a personal note to the person ”kinglouix” that wrote that horrible review, you are completely ignorant and frankly racist! Shame in you!\n",
      "This place is thoroughly disgusting. it is right off state road 50, quite possibly the ugliest road in American in what looks like a converted shed. it feels dirty inside. i went with a large party so they included tip. There were a bunch of white gloves hanging on a fence in the alley parking and i was convinced they were hang drying from strangling possum the night before. The chicken was the identical mystery meat that they hand out free in mall food courts. The thin sliced ribeye was not thin sliced and not from any cow I have ever seen. The short ribs looked like lamb chops and the meat was so tough two tigers couldn't pull it apart. The miso soup was okay but the ecoutrements in the lunch box were not edible. This may be the worst asian food I've ever had. Horrible value and horrible quality. I woke up with night sweats. The experience was so bad I will never even drive by again. AVOID!!!\n",
      "We came here on a Friday night, knowing there would be a function going on at the Maverik Center at 8 pm(which we had tickets for). We called 2 days ahead and made a reservation at 6:30pm, assuming this would give us ample time. We were seated right away, but did not receive either menus or water in the 45-50 minutes we waited. Apparently there was only one server for our area that consisted of at least a dozen tables. We finally got up and left. The service was horrible and reservations apparently mean nothing. What a disappoinment.\n",
      "I am new to Korean food and have only been to one other place (somewhere close to downtown on State Street but I do not recall the name) which was fantastic, so I was excited to try Korean again. The suggestions I found on the internet were to try the bibimbap so after being seated fine and our order taken I was excited. So far everything was going smooth. Here is where it ended. After 30 minutes waiting for the food our waters were empty....nothing....nothing...nothing. Finally our food arrives, well part of the food, our soups were nowhere to be found. At first glance I could tell my bibimbap was VERY overlooked and that NOTHING (vegtables or meat) was fresh. As I said I am new to Korean food but the pictures of the dish on the Internet looked vibrant and fresh with an over easy egg yolk on top. Mine had a overdone egg that had no runny yolk, wilted vegtables and meat that was all gristle. Fine I'll overlook it maybe It will taste ok...no luck there,that fishy taste that was accumulated at the bottom of the rice which was burnt was overpowering. I had to drench the worst dish I have ever eaten in a restaurant with some sauce they gave us just to choke it down. The soup finally showed up, still no refills on the water, and surprise surprise a bland broth with overlooked gummy ramen was what I had to choke down again.....and still NO DARN water to get rid of the horrible tastes in my mouth. On the plus side the little dishes they serve you before hand were good and by the time they noticed neither my friend or me were going to finish our meals we finally got a refill on our waters. My bibimbap set me back $18. 17.50 of which went right to the garbage can. I hate to say this as I have owned a restaurant and would never want a bad review to impact what others may think but I have never had worse food or service in any of the restaurants I have been too in this world. It doesn't take experts to refill water or to even check up on a table once or twice and any chef or line cook can cook better food than what we were served without any formal training. I won't be back and I don't believe I have ever said that about any restaurant I've been too as I am always willing to give a second chance but that fish taste in my dish which had no fish was to much for me to want to try this overpriced restaurant again.\n",
      "We were traveling through Dallas and wanted Asian food. We happened into this shopping mall and had several to choose from, but picked this one. Never having authentic Korean food before, we were a bit nervous about the exterior, but went in to try it out anyway.\n",
      "\n",
      "We were greeted by the hostess and seated in a booth. Our waitress spoke very little English, so it was a bit hard to communicate. However, their menu helped us out a lot. There were a lot of pictures of the food items and a great description of each one along with their associated #. We pointed, she repeated the number and we all smiled! It was all good.\n",
      "\n",
      "The delivery of the food was a bit odd. It took us quite A LONG time to get our food. It came out in bits and pieces. There were four in our party and we all ate at different times, during our hour or so stay. The management must have been made aware of that, since they came over, apologized and gave us a 10% off coupon to use when we paid and one for next time.\n",
      "\n",
      "We love trying new and authentic food places. We knew if the locals ate there it must be good.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our one daughter got an entree, which included 8 side dishes. We thought this was for all us, but asked one of the waiters who spoke English what it was and what each were. He was very helpful in explaining each item and that it only came with the entree. It was kinda fun having so many choices to taste from. We each ended up liking different side dishes. My favorite was the seaweed salad and the pickled garlic stems. Another side was made with Pollack fish---we agreed that was really good, too. Three of us ordered Bento boxes for our lunch. One was spicy chicken and the other two were shrimp. Kinda disappointed---have had Bento boxes before that were out of this world, these were just so/so.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other than the horrible mix up with our order and wait time, we had a GREAT experience there. It was really neat to try truly authentic Korean food.\n",
      "On the advice of a a trip advisor review I checked this place out and was very happy with the food quality and price / value. I ordered the Bebimbap which came with 4 side items including Kimchee -- I foolishly ordered an appetizer, way too much food for one person.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stick with the main dining room however. The outside patio is quiet and appealing but the flies are horrible out there. Very distracting and a touch creepy (covered the things I wanted to be sure to eat with napkins to avoid fly contact). Don't let the patio experience chase you away though, the food and service were great - kept inside all is right with the world. I will be back.\n",
      "In my opinion, Mama’s barely understands korean bbq. They use the wrong grill for the type of meat, so the meat easily gets burnt. However, they are not friendly enough to change the grill before the the food gets burnt.\n",
      "\n",
      "I visited Mama’s 2 times, lunch and dinner. I had pork saute (spicy) at lunch. It was okay. For dinner, we had bulgogi and other types of meat and Korean-style fried chicken. It was horrible. Only the fried chicken was good. (The fried chicken was better then Cafe Korea)\n",
      "We brought a large group to celebrate my birthday and should have realized we might have awful service when we arrived. We told them that we were the group of 16 and they just walked off (hopefully to ask someone?). We were one of the first few tables to arrive (a few mins before 6bpm) and drink orders were taken quickly. However, the tables filled the restaurant and eventually we realized that we would have to go and get our waiter across the room to place our order....after waiting over a half hour AFTER our drinks arrived. Shortly after placing our order at 7pm (an hour after arriving), a few more of our group arrived and sat at one of the empty tables nearby, but not at our assigned tables. This guest was approached by a representative of the restaurant and was rudely told that he must move to another seat...not explaining it wasn't one of our tables, but rather demanded he move. That guest left and did not return again. Food appeared all around us, all the tables (even those that ordered after us) received their meals in full. You would think it might be because the waiter was waiting to serve everyone together. However one of our guests had received his meal about 10 mins before the rest of our food arrived...which our food appeared approximately 8pm (over two hours after we arrived). Many of us were using the BBQ (meaning everything was uncooked when served), so we had many bowls to be laid out. Once the food arrived, the rudeness continued. Bowls were literally tossed onto the table and a nasty look by the waiter was given as it arrived. One table with a group of four was provided all the bowls, as well as the lettuce, rice and sauces that were to go with the BBQ meal. However, us at the larger table received our rice about 15-20 after the meat arrived. And was not even given the lettuce for wrapping, nor the sauces. Eventually, we asked our neighboring table if they could share. The waiter must have seen because he arrived about 10 mins later with the lettuce....but no sauces. We would have asked when he came nearby, but he was NEVER near our table. Only when one of our guests would walk to the other side of the room..and once had to whistle to get their attention, would we have any service. When the bbq was done, Our group finally ate and departed the restaurant at 9pm...THREE HOURS later. The heat element was removed without even asking if we were done (though we were). The waiter just came to our table, reached over us and took it...no words said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The food was very good, but the experience and embarrassment (on our part as the hosts of this party) was not worth ever having a repeat experience. My husband and I use Trip Advisor all the time to hunt and try new restaurants, both in our city and during travel. We have had some amazing meals through reading these reviews and learning through others experiences. Many times I have raved on this site about places we have visited...and have written a couple of \"bad\" reviews with those that we deemed worth the time to report.\n",
      "\n",
      "This one is such an experience...echoed by every single one of our guests. They also didn't get drink refills without having to hunt down our waiter, waited over an hour for their meal, had a waiter (a rare time they were there) reach across other guests to grab someone's glass at the very time they were handing food to another person across the table, other such extreme rudeness and was not given their complete meals. The one star is for the excellent food, so if you must have good Korean, please either go to another highly-rated place or order from the take-out menu. Don't put yourself or your guests through this horrible experience.\n",
      "Awe we had high hopes for this little place but the food was really salty and so greasy. The BBQ beef was just fat, hardly meat. The veg wasn't fresh. We felt really horrible afterwards too. Yuck!\n",
      "After a horrible last visit I thought I'd give Yori another chance. Mistake. Though the food was better and hotter, the service was very poor. Apart from taking my order none of the staff checked to see if I wanted anything else or if the food was okay. I approached them after I was tired of listening to the very loud young lady they placed right next to me at the next table. This young lady was also up and down running outside. She was likely early 20s so old enough to know proper etiquette. The noise carried on and because it was within arm's reach of me it spoiled the experience. I therefore decided to refuse to pay the £2 service charge they placed on my bill. It wasn't a great amount but that wasn't the point. It was the principle. Non existent service deserved not a penny.\n",
      "The girl taking payment looked very upset about my request to only pay for food. First she said I had to pay it because they don't charge tax! Then when I mentioned the failure to intervene with such behaviour from the table next to me, she replied that the noisy young lady was staff! Like that was supposed to make it better! I said that was all the more reason for the young lady to act appropriately. No apology was offered.\n",
      "The other thing was a matter of hygiene in the toilets. Patrons are instructed to not flush toilet paper down the toilet and instead to place used and soiled toilet paper in the bin beside the toilet! Unbelievable! I've never seen this anywhere in London! One of the toilets couldn't flush any way as there was no handle to flush! Very unhygienic.\n",
      "No third chances.\n",
      "I have been coming to Yori for the last few years (did two of my brithdays here, ooops). And it has never disappointed.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the service is not exactly outstanding, it is not horrible either, nothing that has put me off. But the food will make up for EVERYTHING. Everytime I have a craving for Korean food, Yori does a good job in fixing that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their menu is diverse, offering more then bibimbap and the BBQ etc, you will find a lot more interesting dishes you won't have noticed in other restaurants. Even as a vegetarian, I feel spoilt for choices (the kimchi stew is my favourite here)\n",

      "Had my dad's 86th birthday here and will never go back, overpriced for what you were getting, found a blemish hair in my food and was told they had no blond workers. No apology for the hair and refused to call a manager over. I didn't ask for a discount or meal comped and never received it or an apology plus the food was sub par with very little side dishes. I would never go there again horrible experience\n",
      "our food came out an hour later, the staff got our orders wrong, also one of my friends waited more than an hour, and the staff dropped the food by accident and said he'll make a new one. We waited another 45 minutes (already 2hours!) and when we followed it up with him nicely, he started blaming my friend saying it's because she hit his arm, when we were all 7 of us there to see she wasn't even moving from her seat when he was serving us. He said he'll give a refund, but did not even give the full refund for the meal. horrible horrible experience\n",
      "The waiter has horrible service. I highly recommend everyone choose another Korean restaurant!!! First,they didn't have anyone asked us the taste,also never care our small dishes had already finished. Then before we almost done who give the check immediately then tell us \" we should pay more than 15% tips \". How ridiculous it was. I'll never eat it again.\n",
      "We tried this Korean BBQ place because it was right next to our hotel. I wish I would have done some more research and found a place with good reviews. The service was horrible. It took our waiter 15mins to acknowledge us. They never filled our drinks until we asked them to. The food when it came tasted mediocre at best, and for $30 a plate the portions were way too small. I was very disappointed all around. I would not recommend this restaurant.\n",
      "I went to Kimchi 3 times now, the food is good not great in my opinion and quite expensive. The decoration is horrible, I’m sorry but not the best image from South Korea.\n",
      "Food was average! But things got worse when we said we wanted to split the bill! Before going down to pay for the bills the guy at the till (probably the owner) was having a go at one of his waitress, then when I said we would want to split the bill and pay separately, I just wasn't expecting that sort of reaction from him. He started having a go at me for wanting to split the bill ! Typical asian restaurant with extremely poor and horrible customer service!!! Learn what is customer service and implement that at your restaurant!\n",
      "We love Korean food and we'd been looking forward to eating here for a while. Yesterday we went to Kimchi for dinner. We walked through the horrible little door way to be greeted by a dreadful smell of damp and cheap oil. Reluctantly we took our seats. The smell did not pass, a looked around and all I could see was how dirty the place was. Dirty menus, food on the food, dirty tables, cobwebs and dirt on the walls. We couldn't stay here. I don't think they could have paid us to eat here. The place needs a deep clean!! We left before we tried the food, I don't like to get up and lea e but this placed was pretty disgusting!\n",

I hated the food, my wife hated the food, and my two kids hated the food. And the service was horrible too. Although not busy, our children's box lunches were brought to our table almost ten minutes after my wife and I were served. We will not go back.\n",

      "Im Korean so I know about curt and seemingly rude service.. asadal is the worst!!! If you are so miserable, don’t be in the hospitality business. Ugh\n",
      "I love Asadal. I've been there many times, and I would (and will) go back. The food is great. Really tasty. And the atmosphere and decor is very nice. It's a wonderful place to go with a group of friends (enjoying Korean BBQ, and trying different things), to catch up with a friend (you can hear each other, as it's never very loud), or on a date.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "I have a severe food intolerance to garlic, and every time I go, it's such an effort to get an answer as to whether a dish has garlic in it or not. Either they don't understand and have to send someone else over to ask. Or they vaguely understand, but not enough to get that I can't eat it (\"only a little bit of garlic\" isn't a good enough answer).\n",
      "\n",
      "I was there tonight, and I asked the waiter to ask in the kitchen if a dish had garlic. He told me that he didn't think it did. I asked if he can ask. He said \"I think it should be fine\". I said \"it's not fine if it has garlic, I can't eat it, I get very sick\" and he kept repeating that he thinks it won't be a problem. It took a long time to convince him to please just ask. He didn't know that it didn't have garlic, he just kept saying that it's all pre-mixed, so that they can't take it out anyway if it does, but that he doesn't think it does, and that it should be fine. That is not good service.\n",
      "\n",
      "So... in conclusion, great food (worth going back for), terrible service (worth over-looking because the food and venue are great). But it would be great if they could improve on their service. I would easily rate it a 5, if they did.\n",
      "Despite the fact that I eat out often, I have only been to two other Korean restaurants (both in the US), and never one in London. In fact, the two served such horrible food that I've actually avoided them so it was with some trepidation that I went with friends to Asadal. And I really enjoyed the experience. The restaurant is right next door to Holborn tube, down some (frankly smelly) stairs, but the décor is lovely, with screens dividing the restaurant into smaller areas with tables spaced well apart and with some charming artefacts. We decided to opt for the Asadal set menu and began with a tasty dumpling soup followed by glass noodles, the BBQed beef, a vegetable dish mixed with egg and fresh fruit - melon, grapes, apple, orange as a dessert. We asked for the menu for 4 but I think the noodle dish and the sides which accompanied the BBQ would have been the same if there had only been 2 of us. We had to ask for another helping of kimchi, courgettes and bean sprouts and these were (rather reluctantly) provided. Loved the BBQ especially and was not disappointed that it was cooked, to perfection, for us as I tend to make a hash of do-it-yourself. Decided that kimchi was not for me. One reviewer said service was slow - to us, it seemed that the soup, noodles and BBQ were served a little too swiftly, I could have done with more time between courses. Having had a taste now of good Korean food, I will definitely return.\n",
      "We went to this restaurant on December 23rd at 6 pm. We had a small child with us who just asked for plain noodles. This was flatly refused by a member of staff. We asked to speak to the manager who said they could provide glass noodles. Unfortunately the noodles had a a lot of other vegetables and sauce so the little guy really did not want to eat it. So his Dad took him off to a nearby fast food place (not ideal but with a hungry 6 year old not too many options). We then got harassed by the manager and staff as we were waiting for the return of Dad and little guy in order to finish our meal. We ordered a second bottle of wine in order to keep them happy. The manager was rude to me when I explained why we were delaying the next course and seemed to be oblivious to the fact that we were spending almost £150 in the restaurant. All in all a horrible experience and the food is really only mediocre at best.\n",
      "Went here on Friday and was disappointed with the service. It was my first time here and I don’t think I would come back again. First, we had to wait 20minutes for a server to take our order. We actually had to get up and look for a server. We waited for our food for quite a long time. The table beside us sat down about 15mins after us and got their food before us. We kept trying to wave a server over to our table but literally NO ONE was paying attention to us. Everyone kept walking past us even after we kept waving at them and saying “Excuse me!” They would literally make eye contact with us but walk away. We thought maybe the kitchen was backed up with orders but at this time, the restaurant was pretty empty. After about 50 mins of waiting and trying to get someone’s attention we were finally able to ask about our food. And our server tells us she forgot to punch it in. Mind you, there were 5 of us at the table. How can you forget an order of 5 meals????!!!!!!! How do u f*ck up so bad? And her section was not even busy!!! We were infuriated. We would have walked out but we were just too hungry. Finally our food arrives after about an hour of waiting. It took us quite a while to get our bills as well. None of the servers were coming to our table. Our server didn’t even come to our table she had to get someone else to cash us out. THIS IS PATHETIC. They took 25% off our bill and of course we didn’t tip because we received NO CUSTOMER SERVICE AT ALL. Slow service, stupid servers, and mediocre food. First time here and I will never eat here again. My first impression of this place was horrible. The manager/supervisor/who ever was in charge that night did not even come to our table to rectify the situation. RIDICULOUS. The worst Korean restaurant I’ve ever been to\n",
      "The restaurant is super cute with industrial style and very good design yet they put this horrible music and it is so loud that it completely ruins the evening.\n",
      "The food was so so : the BBQ veggies were good and the octopus was soft but didn't like the sauce. The giant soup (35$!) contained all sorts of unidentified pieces ( sausages, cakes, etc) that tasted chewy and a bit gross. They seafood in it was too big and not very inviting. I would not go again !\n",
      "I really love this place. Bulgogi, galbi, dolsot bibimbap, jap chae -- you name it ,then toss in great banchan. I'm horrible with remembering many of the longer names, but I am trying to be better about branching out and trying more things. For the longest time it was near impossible to resist the allure of the scallion and seafood pancake and either the bulgogi chicken or dolsot bibimbap. I'm simple like that. :)\n",
      "\n",
      "I understand how some posters might feel that they cater differently to the Korean clientele than they do others, and that's maybe even a tiny bit fair. There is a language and culture at play that others simply do not share in the same way. We could all likely try to do better at taking into account culture, and in meeting people half-way and not just expecting to be catered to in an unrealistic fashion. I have never, however, felt mistreated or discriminated against in there at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Service might be slow here and there, but it is always friendly. Not too terribly far from here are the only two places I typically get Korean food. Sushi Matoi (formerly Sam Oh Jung) still has a few pages of Korean food in addition to all of the great sushi.\n",
      "Food was OK,.... Service was horrible. Waitress took our order delivered our food and ignored us the rest of the time we were there. Meanwhile another server was intently caring for \"KOREAN\" patrons. We had to interrupt the other server for a second drink. We asked for a mild dish and it came back FREAK'n HOT. Don't get me wrong I like spicy .... this was so hot I could barely stand it. My wife, forget about it. After deciding we were done we sat and waited about 20 minutes before I had to go to the counter and flag our waitress down for the bill. Before we made it out the door she ran past us to the table to check for her tip. Of which there was NONE !!! I was stopped at the door by her saying \"Excuse me sir you no tip me ?\" I replied \"You no SERVICE ...... I no TIP.\" She then put her hand up to dismiss us and walked into another room. I can not put my my finger on it but both my wife and I independently had the feeling that we were ignored because we were not Korean.\n",
      "The price was so expensive and the service was not good. We ordered different kind of pork. Marinated and non marinated. The waiter & waitress helped us to grill the meat but it was horrible. The meat was burnt on the outside and inside it was half raw. And they told us that it was ready to be eaten!!! If this is beef, I'm fine with half done but it was pork! So disappointed.\n",
      "Best for stews, excellent for Black Cod, BBQ; service, sides, setting, parking. I order Doenjang-jjigae, soybean paste stew, most of the time. I've eaten here over 40 times.\n",
      "If a review finds it \"horrible,\" I sympathize but I cannot imagine it. Another great strength is its consistency.\n",
      "This place is more expensive than others in Korea town. But taste and the quality are top of line at K-town. Service is often horrible for the price you pay. I guess this depends on servers.\n",
      "I booked a month in advance. Upon arrival table wasn't ready, so we waited at the bar. The decor/ambiance is out of this world! Particularly the main room! The food list is very limited but certainly drool-worthy (as I read the menu anyway). I was surprisingly shocked when my first dish came out ... I'm a horrible cook, and it looked/tasted like something I would of made. I was very disappointed with the food. Horrible, horrible, horrible! Each dish we tried ranged from 0-3 in taste. It ruined the beautiful atmosphere that I was so taken aback by. I'm sad to report that notwithstanding the beautiful, romantic atmosphere, the food was horrible. Save your money people!\n",
      "I had a horrible meal here. I selected the chef's menu. Most of the courses were mediocre and the entrees were terrible. I ordered my beef medium Rare, and they overcooked one side of it to a hard dry well done. Instead of fixing the mistake in the kitchen and grilling another piece of beef, they simply flipped it over hoping I would not notice. My wife had the lamb which was mushy and disgusting. How did this place get a Michelin star? For a great meal try Mingles, Dosa, Zero Complex or Joo Ok.\n",
      "I had the misfortune to be attended by Donghyuk Shin at Jungsik Bar while visiting Seoul on a business trip with Samsung executives. I had been to the restaurant upstairs as well as the bar before as I love visiting San Pellegrino and Michelin restaurants when I travel for work. I am also an Advanced Somm and so know what the service expectation is at any one of these establishments. Imagine my horror and embarrassment when I was received with disdain and horrendous service by Mr. Shin. When i complained I was pretty much told that I could leave the restaurant, which I did immediately with my group in the middle of my meal. I know that he is studying with the Court of Master Sommeliers and I will be writing them a separate note so they know how horrible he is with actual customers. I will never go back to Jungsik, even the restaurant above, due to this horrible and embarrassing experience. The Samsung execs even work with Michelin Chef's on the Chef Collection Appliances!!!\n",
      "Kyochon SM North edsa is totally the worst! We were one of the two customers who first arrived this day past 4pm, They made us wait for more than 24 minutes saying we still have 5 minutes left to wait for an 8piece red chicken and a garlic rice. There were four more groups of customers who got their orders of chicken already but ours is not yet prepared?! To think that we badly needed to eat before a hassle commute back to Laguna this friday holiday season. How extremely horrible!!\n",
      "\n",
      "A restaurant that wastes their customers' precious time! Is it because I ordered just a few that you don't prioritize my order at all? Is that it, huh? How horrible!\n",

      "It's the christmas season and we are on the rush yet you do this to us! Instead of being able to get home with satisfied stomach, we went on with empty and wasted time! Really outrageous.\n",
      "We went there last month on a saturday night. We even had a reservation but had to wait for quite a while for our table. Thats ok that can happen. The service was nice and explained everything. We took menue 1 and 2. 2 was more expensive than 1 but i personally wouldnt recommend it. Not worth it. The food looked nice but the taste of the side dishes was not that good. Some were good but more than half of it didnt look fresh or tasted good. Maybe some leftovers. The worst thing was the air. They dont have a ventilation at all. Since it was a busy night the air was just horrible. I am not sure if its legal to have a grill restaurant without any ventilation. The service was always good. No complaints aboutthe service. A +. But in the end its about the food which was just average and the air which was really bad. Also the price was too expensive. I wish they would do something about the air and maybe not serve hald of good and half of bad side dishes. Rather serve a bit less and only of good quality.\n",
      "It was raining and thus we were rather than tempted to stay because of the the restaurant atmosphere, we were discouraged to leave due to the weather, because Binari really looked horrible to us: completely empty, and really bad looking.\n",

      "I should start by saying that I've not visited Korea yet, so perhaps I'm not best qualified to judge whether the hotpot I ordered was authentic or not. However, I've been to Korean restaurants in Garden Grove, California, where there is a massive Korean community, and the food there was outstanding. Also, I've had hotpots in Vietnam and Malaysia, so I have an idea of the kind of flavours you get from using local ingredients from such countries.\n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered the spicy meat hotpot (I can't remember the exact title). If you can image going to a cheap all-inclusive buffet somewhere such as Benidorm, grabbing some vegetable left-overs from the evening buffet (such as tinned carrots etc), then in the morning grabbing some cheap low quality bacon, sausages etc from the breakfast buffet, and then adding some spice and broth, then you have the dish that was presented to us. It wasn't horrible by any means, it's just not something I can imagine that you could possibly get in Korea!\n",
      "\n",
      "The young guy serving us was quite friendly, although a bit nervous! He forgot to bring us our drinks at first, but that wasn't any big deal. I asked him if the hotpot was authentic, and he nodded yes, but he can hardly do otherwise!\n",
      "The q was horrible but do not be put off, in fact, it was moving fast and we are a huge group of 14 pax and got a seat less than 20 mins!! I love the soup so so so much. It was so rich and nice, especially at a freezing cold weather of - 14 degree celcius. This is a must visit and highly recommended food!!\n",
      "My family and I visited this restaurant yesterday. This is my first time visiting Korea in 20 years and this place was highly recommended by my hotel concierge. The taste was okay but the service was horrible. It seems like this restaurant is targeting mainly towards Chinese tourists as the whole place was filled with Chinese tourists, including the staff. I have nothing against Chinese but I would like the staff to be able to communicate with non Chinese customers. These RUDE Chinese staff do not respond to Korean nor English. The servers never greet you nor try to help you with anything. I had to self serve water and constantly flag them down to order the food. They don't even bother to talk to customers in full sentence. They just say \"order?\" \"wait!\" etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "My wife found a long hair in the food and of course they would not own up to their mistake. They just talked in Chinese among themselves and walked away. I was fed up and made a complaint to the manager. Of course the manager was apologetic but I knew he's just putting on a show as there were more Chinese tourists waiting in line outside.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stay away from this place. There are lot more great restaurants in Seoul. I will never return to this place again.\n",
      "This restaurant was highly recommended to us for its traditional Korean ginseng chicken soup. Restaurant is located just passed an alley, didn't notice English signs but we guessed it right by the big chicken signboard above the entrance. It's a few traditional style buildings. Each house seats few rows of tables. No chairs, just cushions to sit on the floor. I like it for its 'authenticity' but just horrible during winter, with so many strangers dining in a room & shoes off, there's a strong odour of stinky feet. Service was lacking, it was nearly towards the end of our meal when a lady finally came to top up our tea cups. Every1 in our party of 5 decided they had tastier ginseng chicken soup outside of Tosokchon. We were only impressed with d ginseng flavored roast chicken. Suggest to try it for once. But we all unlikely to return for more ginseng chicken soup.\n",
      "If I have a choice nt to even rate one star I would. Most horrible restaurant I have been during my 3 weeks tour in US & Europe. Restaurant smelled foul . The Koreans are rude and loud!\n",
      "The food was decent, but the service was horrible. We were made to wait whilst having a reservation, refused water when asked at the counter during the wait and told that thats just the way it is. While at the table the staff was unresponsive and cooked meat for another table at ours after seating us - would not be returning again.\n",
      "For anyone who has traveled extensively in Korea this restaurant will register as on the lower end of average for taste, higher end for price, and low end for cleanliness. The \"attraction\" is that you first visit the butcher shop to choose your cuts of meat which are overpriced. Next, wait in the waiting room, holding your meat, for up to a half hour for your number to be called. Then, you are led to your table and standard dishes are dropped off and you cook up your meal over hot coals. While All That Asia was not impressed at all with the food or experience we will lay out the pros and cons:\n",
      "\n",
      "Pros: You can pick your own cuts of meat. The restaurant is in Bomun and close to tourist hotels and easy to find and walk to.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cons: Overpriced for the food quality and service. The restaurant is busy and staff is not attentive. If you press the call button on your table don't expect anyone to show up, you will have to flag someone down or go looking for them. There are no smoke hoods over your grill and thus the smoke from cooking goes everywhere. This was surprising as the little smoke hood vacuum system is standard even in the cheapest of Korean BBQ joints. The side dishes are very low quality and the veggies (such as bean sprouts) look like they have been sitting out for a while!\n",
      "\n",
      "Final verdict: Is the food horrible? No. Is it overpriced? Yes. However, remember, you are in one of the most touristy cities in Korea and they do not have to depend on repeat business and the foreigners they deal with usually have limited experience with Korean BBQ. If you tell yourself, \"hey, this is a tourist town no different than my own country\" you will be just fine with the price you pay and the food you get. It is an acceptable choice for convenience and the food is okay. It does offer an unique experience and they do have a sheet of English instructions to help you out.\n",
      "This place definitely caters to the Austrians. Has it been Austrianized? The Ban-Chans do not taste right and food is not too authentic. After 5 days of horrible bland Austrian cuisine, this fusion restaurant did the job of satisfying my Korean craving taste buds but I wouldn't come here if this place was in NY or DC. Sorry to say that but it's true. I suggest to the owners that they need to put some more kimchi in kimchi jiggae instead of a ton of onions and make better kimchi!\n",
      "This place is horrible. Food is horrible, service is terrible, we were charged twice for a plum wine. I was told by my Korean Friend that only tourist come to this place. Avoid at all cost !\n",
      "The food was extremely over priced. The service was horrible the employees there had such a bad attitude me and my husband almost wanna just leave The restaurant immediately.. overall a restaurant that doesn't worth time and money at all..\n",
      "Long wait for horrible food, poor quality, terrible service, over priced and filthy place. This is a poor take on Korean BBQ. There are much better places to enjoy Korean food in Taipei City so just save yourself the trouble and disappointment.\n",
      "Went here with my wife and 3 year old girl. They were very accommodating even bringing extra corn for the little one. The bbq was great and the staff super friendly. The only down points were the menus were falling apart which let's down the overall feel on the restaurant and those chop sticks are bloody horrible. Who comes up with thin metal rectangles for chop sticks! Over all awsome the bbq is a must try\n",
      "Ok, where do I start...? I don't enjoy writing bad reviews but people need to know. I also am not a picky eater.\n",
      "This place is horrible. My friend and I walk in at 6:30pm and there was only one couple in this little place in the heart of downtown Flagstaff. That should have been a sign to walk out.\n",

      "The one and only waitress there was probably about 23 and nice but, well.....\n",
      "So I ordered the miso soup and upon the advice of the waitress, I also ordered the cabbage pancake. My friend ordered a seafood and tofu spicy soup/stew.\n",
      "The miso was a bit sour as though it had vinegar in it. I thought that was strange but I managed to eat it anyway. My friend wasn't too excited about her soup either (which had little or no seafood as far as we could tell) and lots of silken tofu but she ate most of it. I tried her soup and I didn't care for it. The flavors were overwhelming.\n",
      "My cabbage pancake comes out and it fills a large plate, so good portion size. It was smothered in BBQ sauce. EEW! I managed to eat 3 bites and I just couldn't eat any more. The flavors were way overwhelming. The waitress finally comes back around and I tell her I don't like this. She says, “Oh, I'm sorry.........would you like to order something else?” I said, “Yes, the fried shrimp please.” And my friend ordered the same. She didn't clear the plate away that had the pancake on it which annoyed me so I put it on another table.\n",
      "They never should have put a picture of the shrimp on the menu. The shrimp that came out were pathetic, small compared to the picture and very overcooked. I could only eat 3 out of the 6.\n",
      "The bill comes out and the cabbage pancake was on the bill. I got the waitress's attention and I said, “The cabbage pancake wasn't taken off of the bill.” She said, “We can't take it off the bill because you touched it.” So I said, “But I didn't like it so why should I have to pay for it?” She said, “We've had too many people do this and not pay so we can't take it off [Umm HELLO! Obviously you need to change a few things here so that doesn't keep happening!]. The best we can do is remake it without the sauce....” I replied, “Well, you can be sure I will never come back here again.” When she brought my credit card back I told her, “Just so you know, the only thing I 'did' enjoy was the tea and rice. I didn't like anything else (shrimp, miso and pancake). She sweetly said, “I'm sorry.” I paid $25 for a horrible meal. On the way out she cheerfully said, “Have a great night!” Grrrr\n",
      "\n",
      "Next time I will stick with one of the best place to eat in Flagstaff right across the street, Criollo. So worth the usual wait.\n",
      "First entered and was seated within 3 minutes. We sat at the end of the room and it was very crowded, we were moving tables to get room. It was freezing cold as well, asked the waitress to turn off the fan, but never happened (Beginning of Fall), others were commenting on the cold air the fan was producing as well. The menu was over priced, I had a BBQ bowl for 14 bucks and had very little meat in it, mostly rice and veggies, my partner had the ramen that looked like it came from a 10 cent package. Although the food was good to great but small portions, I would rate the service and atmosphere horrible. We were giving our check right after our food was served, which came after a long wait. Needless to say good food, might try lunch time specials, but dinner time will not see me again.\n",

      "The food is low quality and it shows. For the price I expect better flavor meats and sides. The side sauces were awful, the red sauce Korean sauce tasted like bad tomato paste cocktail sauce instead of a spicy sweet chili sauce.\n",
      "\n",
      "The service was unbelievably horrible. We never knew who our waiter was and we are not picky or demanding customers. We simply requested a refill for our water container along with a bowl of steamed rice for the four of us at the table. They proceed to come back to the table 4 times because they forgot we ordered \"brisket, rice & refill of our water container\". I kid you not; they brought the brisket after returning to ask what meat we ordered because he forgot. After the brisket was almost done cooking we had to ring the bell and ask for our rice and water. Again, very serious they return 10 mins later with the rice. We ask (kindly; because I know how you can just have a \"off\" night; I get that) for our water. He says yes be right back. We didn't see him much later and had to flag another waiter down (which I absolutely hate doing because I feel it is rude) but it was necessary because call me crazy I like to have a liquid beverage when I eat!\n",

      "The grill fire kept going out at the beginning which was a hassle.\n",
      "\n",
      "HOWEVER;\n",
      "\n",
      "I could handle all of the above and have before but what I cannot handle is HEALTH CODE violations!\n",
      "\n",
      "Every time we order a meat they brought out a tray of raw meat (which is typical of this type of restaurant) BUT they proceeded to only place a small about on the grill AND proceeded to place our RAW meat on the half wall beside our table across the walking aisle beside another table!!!!! OMG! We had plenty of room on our table to place extra meat! There was NO reason to place our meat in the open! Wow!! We were not the only table they did this to; I'm shocked! I took many pictures for you all to view! Mine will be labeled \"Never Again\".\n",

      "I am just so fortunate that no one in our party of four got sick!!! Yuck!\n",

      "Please save your sanity and just find another Korean BBQ place! I could name many to choose because our family loves Korean BBQ and know what is expected when you go and this is NOT it, but I will keep this review about Honey Pig and not promoting any other restaurant. Please pass up this place.\n",
      "The preparation was presented well but it did satisfy our taste buds at all. The atmosphere was cool the men's bathroom was clean but my wife said the women's bathroom was horrible. Overall we didn't enjoy our time at Honey Pig.\n",
      "My husband loves all types of food with him being in the military he went all over the world he wanted to try this place, so we decided to go, we didn't like it one bit, the amount of food we got was okay but the taste was horrible We ended up going to eat at Wendy's as soon as we left because none of us was satisfied. The place was packed we waited for almost an hour so we thought it would be good but sadly it wasn't. I am deff not coming back :/ they are kinda pricy so if you go & don't like it, don't say I didn't warn you :)\n",
      "I have been there twice. On the first visit, the fillet chicken was quite nice but the chicken with bones was hard to eat as the batter was thick and sort of doughy. The noodles in a set menu was utterly horrible, the soup tasting like luke-warm water and the noodles were all stuck together. Told the staff about the noodles and heard \"You have to separate them yourself.\" Had to explain her it was the kitchen staff who should have stirred the noodles while boiling them, not to mention impolite manners as I wouldn't expect great customer service from so-called Korean restaurants with full of non-Korean staff.\n",
      "\n",
      "On my second visit, they didn't have the spicy flavour I wanted. The army soup looked unappealing and unauthentic. So, only ordered chicken fillets and Asahi. They also told me to share a table with others as one table unoccupied is reserved(No one came until I left) and it was so awkward to do so myself. They could have put smaller tables in the first place I imagine.\n",
      "\n",
      "I understand I cannot expect the same flavours and quality as I had back home but am pretty sure they could do a bit better.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, fillets with sweet and spicy flavour are recommendable for a quick snack but no other dishes. I would say Asahi draft(Japanese beer) was the best bit of this place.\n",
      "There was a MAGGOT crawling around in our raw thin sliced beef, absolutely horrible!!! I went to the staff to show it, they reacted far from appropriate.\n",
      "They went to the kitchen, took the maggot out and then came back pretending what I saw was a piece of radish!! Instead of admitting there was a MAGGOT in our meat, they acted as if I saw it wrong.Thankfully our neighbours saw it too.\n",
      "Still cannot believe this happened and the disrespectful way they treat their costumers. Not to think about that there was a LARVE in our food which means it is far from fresh. NEVER GO THERE\n",

      "So this trip to NYC I tried two Korean restaurants, this was the other. I ordered the Beef bulgogi and have to say it's the worst beef bulgogi i've ever had!! I mean it was digusting. It was watery, and the kimchee which was with it was also horrible. Large lumpy tasteless pieces of cabbage. Definitely won't be returning. I tried another down the road which was much better. Surprised this has such great reviews. Prob the worst $22 i've ever spent at a Korean restaurant, urgh.\n",
      "Me, my GF and her brother recently visited Toronto and decided to visit Kimchi Korea House for Lunch since it had great reviews. From the moment we came in to the moment we left I realized we had made a big mistake coming in here.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was our first time at a Korean restaurant and we weren’t familiar with the dishes but we wanted to get out of our comfort zone and enjoy something new. My GF had pork bibimbap and didn’t realize it would be so spicy, which upset her stomach. She requested to change the dish with the server who was incredibly rude in saying he couldn’t do anything and asked “what do you want me to do?” “You still have to pay for it you know?” Then the owner/manager came to critique my GF and ask how she doesn’t understand this Korean restaurant has spices which we explained it was our first time at a Korean restaurant and our first time here. We were very unfamiliar with the menu and it should of been the job of the server to clarify it. Nevertheless she did replace the dish begrudgingly. At the end she kept criticizing my GF and told her she should find somewhere else to eat next time.\n",
      "\n",
      "The best part was her questioning me about not giving tip. I explained that I didn’t appreciate the service we received and that the server was horrible. I’m surprised this place has such positive reviews because our experience was horrible and almost ruined the rest of our expectations in Toronto. If someone asks me about places to try in Toronto I would definitely not recommend this place, in fact they should go as far away as possible and completely avoid it.\n",
      "This restaurant is at a good location. We went there when they were about to close for lunch break and we actually got in as the last guests for lunch time. So many guests stopped by and was declined seats after we went in because they stopped accepting new guest.\n",
      "The food was horrible though. They were so salty and we couldnt finished it. The staffs were also rude because they wanted to take break.\n",
      "Wouldnt visit this place again.\n",
      "We used to frequent this low cost, casual and family friendly restaurant but after a long break, we went back last weekend and to tell you the truth - I was disappointed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The kimchi was not very nice (I would usually get a take away tub for home...it WAS that good)....the other vegetables were not up to their usual standard. Even the spring rolls were horrible.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the first time, the owner was not present - I wonder if this had anything to do with it?\n",
      "\n",
      "I won't be going back. The trade off for sitting in a smoke filled environment and coming out stinking like a BBQ was that the food was incredible. Without incredible food, I'll find somewhere else. It's such a shame.... :(\n",
      "Came here for a dinner one night as I thought the food could be good since the decor was so nice. I was thoroughly disappointed with my meal. I had few banchans (which had to be ordered separately) and a vegetarian soondubu jjigae (spicy soft tofu stew). The soondubu was super watery- barely any flavor. The bean sprouts, spicy cucumber banchan were decent- but they didn't offer any refills even though I had to pay for them separately. I also ordered the lotus root, but it was super sweet- and tasted horrible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall- the food wasn't great and neither was the service. So if you are craving Korean food- this isn't the right place. If you want a pseudo-Asian, inauthentic food with nice decor- then this could be a nice option.\n",
      "so last week my parents and I decided to check out the place after my sister said the branches on Yonge St were great. We went to the Queen St restaurant around 3pm (after all you can eat finishes) on a Sunday afternoon. We walk inside, no one greets us except for a table bus boy who just points at us to sit down, so we get a table. Then after 10mins a waiter comes by, doesn't speak proper or full English, probably an exchange student. It is our first time there, so we ask what is popular/deals for lunch, he just mumbles answers.\n",
      "So we choose some dishes (raw meat) for us to cook on the grill, that is the experience of going to Korean grill house right? my mom orders a Ramen soup.\n",
      "so 15 mins pass, we see a couple further down who arrived after us, get a ramen, and we think okay thats weird. Then another family gets their raw dishes before us, and this is another 10mins later so in all we've been waiting 25 mins. We ask the boy who served us whats going on, he says 'oh cause you ordered raw dishes it takes time\". We point out how other people have already gotten their food, he walks away.\n",
      "now almost a half hour has passed, we see our waiter at a table near the kitchen eating HIS lunch, so we call a girl to our table, ask whats going on or we are leaving, she says \"sorry ramen will take another 2-3mins, and it takes time to heat up your hotplate for the raw dishes\". I tell her \"do you know we've been waiting over 25 mins for Ramen and raw food?!!\"\n",
      "she thought we arrived 10 mins ago and haven't been waiting long, so we complained and left. Worse service i've ever had, staff dont even speak proper English nor smile and greet customers. OH and we waited over 25 mins for Ramen?!!! what a joke. I am going to try the Korean Grill house on Yonge St, and hope that isn't as horrible as the Queen St place was.\n",
      "this is a chinese restaurant in attempt to mimic the Korean BBQ experience.\n",
      "I've visited South Korea last year for months and this restaurant was a pure mockery of what the Korean restaurant is all about.\n",
      "Not a single menu, not a single \"meat\" was what an actual Korean restaurant would serve.\n",
      "They've collected a bunch of low quality meat that you would find in Chinatown and they decided to have you throw it on a grill (which doesn't even match what the real traditional Korean grill looks like) and call it Korean. It's absolutely revolting having people visit this restaurant and have them claim that they have had Korean BBQ.\n",
      "horrible food, horrible experience. I will stay away\n",
      "Too bad the food was OK, but the waiters were terrible. First of all, we are tourists in Rome, we don't speak Italian (yes, we understand Italian, but still...). Somehow, the Indian waiter spoke English when we arrived, but when we requested for a dish that was implying a hot stove on the table (extra work for them and the kitchen stuff) he started to speak only Italian with us and denying the order to us. And the Korean lady waitress she refused to bring us the dish that we ordered, saying that she can only do this for 2 people, not for one - all in Italian, of course, luckily we understood. In the menu the dish we asked for was an appetizer and it wasn't mentioned anywhere that it is for two. The roughness of the personnel is not doing your business any good. Smiling? Politeness? Forget about it. The food itself was almost as good as in an average place in Korea. Shame. And the point that was most disappointing was the horrible mess and dirtiness in the kitchen area. Unfortunately, I saw this only after I finished eating, as I missed the entrance to the bathroom and got into the kitchen where I froze: food lying around in boxes placed on the floor, messy and untidy kitchen. I missed the rats, they were probably the cooks there... Bad experience, never again.\n",
      "Service is the redeeming feature here, friendly helpful staff. The Katsu chicken was truly a horrible culinary offering, perched on a slab of over glutinous semi warm rice surrounded by a moat of cheap \"chip shop\" curry sauce rendered chilly by the cold plate. Thai red curry was a bowl of sticky rice with the curry stirred through, it was thick with too much coconut cream, at least it was warm and tasty but lacked any freshness or chilli heat. I came because of the reviews, I should have read the poor ones as well as the good.\n",
      "And I mean that. I have had Korean food in England, Indiana, Illinois, California, Korea...\n",
      "\n",
      "As someone of Korean heritage, I crave Korean food every single day. So after craving Korean food for months I break down and go to this horrible restaurant (because it is the only one in the city) in the hopes of having a taste of home. I go there knowing that it is going to be awful and every time I leave I am seriously almost in tears because it is that unsatisfying.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today, I have vowed never to go back again. Not only was the quality of food awful as I expected, but the proprietors have proven that they aren't really even Korean at heart. I have never been to a Korean restaurant that charges for Kimchee, which is a stable of Korean food.\n",
      "\n",
      "And for those of you who think that it is a quality Korean restaurant because there are a lot of Asians who eat there. Whenever I've been in there, there may be Asians there, but from what I can tell they are not Korean and if they are, I can only guess that they are desperate like me and don't know how or don't have the time to cook Korean food for themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "I already tell all my friends in Milwaukee that this is not a good representation of Korean food and ask that they not eat at Seoul Korean Restaurant because I would be embarrassed to have them think that this is what Korean food tastes like. And now I'm telling you, random internet people, that real Korean food tastes so much better then the swill that is served at that restaurant.\n",
      "We came to Benu because it had been recommended by some friends who are considered to be foodies and having read raving reviews. We expected a feast. We actually had a horrible experience. First, we were seated 30+ minutes after the reservation time - considering that our reservation was for 9:30 PM - it was very late. True, the staff was apologetic and considerate. But then two happened - we were given the tasting menu as the only choice of the evening . WE found out later that other people were able to order a la carte. Not a fair and not an honest thing to do - of course, the tasting menu was much more expensive. The restaurant HAD to disclose all the options. Then the food started coming. It was not appetizing looking and rarely it tasted OK, at times just disgusting. We were not half through the initial items on the menu when we felt we were almost full but we all had this bad feeling of having eaten something bad. I was nauseous, so was my daughter. Many of the food items looked just repulsive. There were 4 of us and we have very different tastes but we were unanimous - that food is terrible and we will never ever come back here. My daughter felt nauseous for 3 days afterwords and could nog bring herself to eating for the same amount time. Same happened to me - for 2.5 days. Is it a 3 Michelin star restaurant? Wow.... The terrible thing is that I had a friend from Moscow who is a very famous Russian actor - so I wanted to treat him to something very special. Special it was - never again. We were unable to finish eating - we never even got to the main courses - so badly we felt - physically. True, the management charged us not the full amount.\n",
      "Portion size is that of a kid's meal. The Quality of the ingredients were very poor.\n",
      "All 3 dishes had basic soy sugar coating plus ton of MSG.\n",
      "If you cooked like this in Korea No One will go there period !.\n",
      "Bean sauce was thinned down to save money.\n",
      "Everything tasted stale .... Never again ,a horrible place.\n",
      "I am truly ashamed for all Korean people.\n",
      "Went to the branch in west end on the Tuesday evening. Food was great but service was horrendous. Our food arrived and the soup came with rice (which we didnt ask for but assumed it was complimentary as the bibimbap also came with miso soup). When the bill came my friend noticed we were overcharged for the rice and told the waitress. She then got super rude saying something along the lines of... \"you should of gave the rice back etc\" despite us not ordering or knowing it wasnt complimentary like the soup was. Not professional and rude to lecture a customer when it was the staffs fault in charging us for something that can be easily mistaken for being complimentary. It gets better. I wanted to order for a takeaway as my boyfriend wanted some food to have at home so when the waitress comes back over I place my order. She proceeds to comment on the fact that I could of ordered/paid for all the food together. Does the staff not understand food gets worse (especially the kfc) the longer its sitting in a bag. It is common sense to order for takeaway last minute to make it fresh as possible. At this point I feel the waitress just let the cheek get the better of her than common sense. When the bill came for the takeaway it was around £7, my change from the previous bill was around £6.5 so I didnt have enough change so just asked for the rest to be paid on card. I understand there are minimum card charges which is £1 for Bibimbap so I said thats fine just take the pound off my card and she continues to make rude remarks \"what so you want to pay 45p etc\" like at this point she is literally complaining about taking my money. I tapped my card and as soon as i did i realised it was for the full amount despite specifying for the remainder to be paid on card. The scottish waitress didnt understand simple english instructions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The whole situation screams with rascist undertones as im chinese like many of the diners there in the west end. Despite it being an honest mistake with the extra rice it just implied she thought we were stingy chinese customers trying to scam rice or something. Clearly prejudged us from the beginning as i always make an attempt to be polite to the waitress as i work as a supervisor in an asian restaurant myself and know how horrible rude customers can. But no she was just rude from the beginning.\n",
      "I had eaten here before many years ago. The experience was okay so decided to return. Upon entering the establishment, there is a very distinct moldy odor. May be some underlying issue there. My mother and I were eating together at the time, but she isn’t a fan of Korean food and wasn’t very hungry, so she just wanted a few bites off of my plate. Waitress seemed annoyed at the fact that we both did not order our own plates and also when we asked for an extra plate and utensils. When I got my soup, it had a small hair in it. It was gross but I wasn’t too fond of the soup so I just ignored it. When I went to pay, the cashier was extremely rude to me after I refused to pay a minimum of a 15% gratuity, which I did not think was deserved. She was being very confrontational and loud and basically trying to force me to pay it. At that instant I got very upset. She had no idea if I was going to pay a cash tip and just assumed I wasn’t tipping at all. I told her to put no tip at all after she started making a scene and arguing with me. She still persisted with trying to get me to press a button, which had a tip varying from 15% to 25% only. At that point, she became extremely loud and made sure everyone in the restaurant was aware of what was happening. I couldn’t believe her attitude and sense of entitlement. She harassed me for a tip for a very uncomfortable amount of time. After getting my receipt and being forced to take a pic of the itemized bill she refused to give me a copy of, I finally told her to shut up and I walked away. At that point she started cussing at me. Totally uncalled for behavior and just in total disbelief that this type of behavior is acceptable against customers here. Will never eat here again. Not sure how the reviews here are so high when the food is not that great and the service is absolutely terrible. Employees have horrible attitudes and treat their customers like crap when they don’t get what they want. There are way better Korean restaurants out there! Stay away from this one!\n",
      "I eat Korean often and wanted to take a group of people from work to try for the first time. The first experience form many was not a good one. Not only did the restaurant have a horrible smell (to me it smelled like Cats) the service was lacking as well. Everything moved very slowly and it was hard to keep our water glasses full. I recommended to the group, usually a \"safe\" dish, beef bulgogi, it was terrible. I ordered the same thing and no taste at all and very bland. Overall this experience was lacking and the odor was almost unbearable.\n",
      "I don't know how this place got such good reviews. This place had the worst food. The service was horrible. They were rude and acted like they were doing a huge favor for us when we asked to have our water glasses refilled. It was dirty and lacked any form of Korean hospitality. Not a place I will return to. They must have friends and family do false reviews. Went because of the reviews won't return because of the horrible food and lack of service.\n",
      "They're duck and vegetable fried rice are to die for! My husband and I get it every time! Prices aren't horrible either!\n",
      "The place is nicely decorated but that’s all. Food was just ok, not spicy at all. As a person who is quite familiar with Korean dishes, I’m very disappointed. First of all, panchan is only one round and the kimchi was horrible. Secondly, we’ve asked if the tea is complementary and the waitress said yes and asked what kind of tea we wanted. But then in the bill we were charged for the tea. I’ve ordered “supposedly” very spicy soup but it was very watery. So I’ve asked for spicy sauce but in the end I was charged for the “Djan”. There was also a service charge of 250rubles included. We don’t speak Russian fluently but explained ourselves as clear as possible calmly. We explained that we were told the tea is included with the dishes but instead of nicely explain there was a misunderstanding, the girl started to talk very rude without even apologizing. She even shouted at us saying “think logically, why we would offer a tea? You already drank the tea so pay!!” Never had such a service. After almost 10 minutes of argument, at the end they removed the tea from the bill. The girl ran after us when we had already left the restaurant apologizing and asking to come back for a coffee but it was way too late. If they were gonna apologize and offer something then they should have done it earlier when we first explained that there is a mistake. They completely ruined our dinner by stressing us so much for such a little issue.\n",
      "I ordered ТАК КАЛЬБИ / 닭갈비\n",
      "Decent size and it was very tasty, but almost half of the plate was chicken bones. With very little meat here and there.\n",
      "I am not that familiar with Korean cuisine and maybe it is a norm, but it was very hideous.\n",
      "Another downside of this restaurant was a horrible service. It was so bad one cannot image. Waitresses manage to pass by so many times without asking if the food is alright.\n",
      "Beer was served after meal was on a table for a minimum 10 minutes. Huge mistake given how spicy the food is.\n",
      "Again, the restaurant was almost empty and there so many waitresses, but somehow they manage such unthoughtful service.\n",
      "I flew few times with Korean airlines and it was always superb caring service. Something not Korean at all at this restaurant and one should demand better service.\n",
      "I had the green curry and it was pretty horrible. Almost inedible... super watery... barely any flavor but I guess the rice was cooked decent. It didnt resemble a curry it was just milk with chicken and brocolli. I don't know how they could serve this with any pride. Avoid at all cost!!! Supposedly the owner is thai but if she had any thai in her at all she should be ashamed for serving me that curry. I think it used to be better before new ownership! I recommend Pho Vietnamita bistro if u want Asian food.\n",
      "I love Korean food. Having Korean a sister-in-law and bff, I am very familiar with Home made Korean food. This place did not serve what I was used to, it was not horrible, and fed my growing teens very well. But I will probably not go back.\n",

I walked in for a meal with the family and we had made a booking of eight people but we only arrived to realise they hadn't saved a table for us and placed us at the bar and promptly gave us the group menu and told us it was the only one, they finally seated us at a tiny four seater table and said it was the only free table. We ordered our meale which was $39 a person for the cheapest meal after being told that it was quite affordable by the manager. We find out after placing our order that there was a smaller cheaper menu. We were left to cook our own meal and tge power source was right at my toes. All in all it was a horrible experience and i do not recommend it to anyone.\n",

Is just like water mix with some chilli sauce, with cheese in it!!!!!! The meat taste sour and it is really bad!!! We told the waiter that food is so nasty that we can't eat it.\n",

      "We wanted Korean food, but the Kimchi Soup was terrible - It clearly tasted like canned food - when kimchi is so easy to do - Nothing tatsted like a fresh food - For this horrible kimchi they charged not less than 300 Rs per person, wich is equivalent to two fresh dishes in any other restaurant - At the ground floor, the terrace is too narrow and didnt make us feel safe\n",
      "\n",
      "We don't recommand this place, espacialy not for eating\n",
      "To begin with, the floors were dirty. The staff taking orders were completely uninterested, and got the wrong item. Then, did not even bother to replace it. It was a horrible experience.\n",
      "Ate here with my spouse. Bad customer service they are really busy and don’t take time. Food was good. Atmosywas horrible. Lots of smoke in the air. I tried to tell the waiter but she said it’s her first day. Hmm.\n",
      "I went here just last Sunday with my gf and mom. We came in just after 10PM for the night owl. Just after we finished our first order, we had ordered for another round of rice. Both servers kept coming back to other tables to fill up their water and dropped off their orders and completely avoiding our table. I had to ask another waiter for the rice we ordered because our food was already getting cold just waiting for it. This time I wondered if they're still planting the rice behind the kitchen and waiting to harvest it to be cooked.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, our server came to our table and told us we had to place in our last orders but it was only 10:40 and they close at 12. I complained that I had ordered for rice long time ago. When it finally came, I was offended by how little the rice was that they had given us. It was literally two table spoon. I called my server to get me another one because of how little it was. I noticed that few people kept coming in hoping to get a table but they kept refusing to sit them in other available tables that has been cleaned so they sent them away. The employees here lack good service, and are eager to leave right away so we felt so rushed. When I asked for the bill, it came right away but my order took forever. Anyways, I only tipped my server $1 because of the bad experience and horrible service. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE WHO WANTS A GOOD TIME AND GOOD EXPERIENCE. THIS IS COMING FROM A SERVER MYSELF.\n",
      "We were looking for a proper dinner with soup and found this restaurant. Menu was quite variable so we decided to have dinner here. We ordered pork bone soup and chicken ginseng soup. The portion of pork bone soup was generous and served in hot clay pot together with a bowl of rice, while the chicken ginseng soup was horrible. It was served in small ceramic bowl with A very very tiny piece of chicken and sushi-portion sticky rice. There's only just one tiny little piece of chicken! FYI, the pork bone soup costs CAD7.99++ and chicken ginseng soup CAD5.99++. After the meal, when the waiter came to clear up the table, we complained. The respond of the waiter was unprofessional and rude. He looked like that he was pretending not understand us. He said that this soup is only for one person and not expensive. Every complaining customer in the world always expect an apology from the waiter even though that is not him who cooked the food, but this waiter didn't. While we were finishing our drink, he talked with his colleagues in Mandarin that the soup was not enough for me. How rude they talked about their customers in the back and that customers understand Mandarin!! It is not about enough or not enough for one person! It is about how you serve the food in a proper way. When we paid at the cashier, this waiter did not say THANK YOU or SORRY!! He just received the money and left. How rude!! How stingy they are to serve food to customer in Canada. I wonder if they are going to treat the same to big Canadian customer.\n",
      "The gf and I fancied having a Korean bbq and thought going for the buffet was a good idea. The restaurant opens at 6. We arrived at 6:05... And wasn't seated till 6:15 as the staff was still getting ready with only 2 couples ahead of us...\n",
      "\n",
      "The place itself looks decent but upon actually sitting down and having a decent look it was actually quite dirty... We had drops and marks of grease by the grill, the table we sat on had sticky patches and the very useless extractor fan above the grill had cobwebs hanging from it... To top it off one of the waiters did not wash their hands after going to the toilet!\n",
      "\n",
      "The service was unfriendly and extremely unattentative with very poor customer service... For starters we couldn't even hear our waitress properly because she was way to quiet! And to top it off we had numerous things forgotten and needed constant reminding and people that was seated after us was being served their food before we could!\n",
      "\n",
      "The food itself was ok and nothing to brag about at all. We are use to grilling the meat ourselves but the waitress just started chucking all our meat on the grill without asking... When we orders the extra meat it did take a good 15 minutes and we could see why as 3 out of the 4 meats was still frozen!\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall we will not be going back. Poor service combined with poor hygiene for this day and age is not acceptable. The only reason there is 2 stars is that the food wasn't horrible but just barely hit the standard quality minus the frozen part... And to have the cheek to add service charge to the bill is a joke!\n",
      "Most horrible dining experience in my life.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was very busy tiring week at work. I decide have nice Korean food to cheer up. And it ended up a horrible dinner.\n",
      "\n",
      "I went alone. And it was after 9. I didnt have enough time to go Korean restaurants in central. I wanted to have BBQ. But the Chinese waiter told me \"sorry minimum order is 2 portion. I ordered pork belly and sirloin which cost about £20. And the waiter spoke to me \" sorry you can't have BBQ because you are alone. It's only available minimum two people\" That's the most ridiculous thing I ever heard in my life that I can't have a meal in this restaurant because I'm alone. Besides this is not first time I came to this restaurant alone and it was never a problem before. There were only 4 other tables so they weren't even busy - In fact very quiet for a Saturday night. I asked which part of your menu says I can't have BBQ if I'm alone. And he kept refusing. I asked for a manager to come then he said \"the waiter made a mistake. It's minimum order 3 portion. But I will make it for you. \" I'm sorry but your staff already told me minimum 2 portion of BBQ. And your menu doesn't say I can't order less than 3 portions. Another very concerning thing I heard from this manager was when I asked what draft beer they have. \" I'm sorry but I don't recommend it because it's very old. It's more than 2 weeks and half old\". Disgusting! These people think it's not ok to serve but dont replace it with a new barrel?!\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally I finished my irritating time for order. When my food arrived, the waitress turned the fire on and left the cover of BBQ plate and walked away. For 10mins! No one come to take the lid out. As a Native Korean, making BBQ is not so difficult that I would have to wait for the waitress to do it. So I opened the heavy glass lid and put it on the table and put my pork and vegetables on. When I started eating BBQ they brought my noodles ( Bibim nengmyen) which I told I will have after BBQ. Which is common sense in a Korean bbq restaurant. So I told waitress I asked for the noodles after my BBQ meal. She took it away and said sorry. Then 10mins later another waitress brought noodles again!! I told her I already told the other waitress I asked for them after finish my BBQ. Is it that difficult to communicate about my meal while they are chatting and eating food in the entrance of kitchen?\n",
      "\n",
      "While I'm eating pork the manager came an turned off my fire even though I had beef on the table to cook. No asking to put beef or turn to low fire. Just turned it off then stood about 2m away from my table. I had to wave to another waitress put fire back on for my beef! Of course no one came to check my BBQ or asked to help.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally I finished my bbq and asked for the noodles. And not surprisingly , they brought the same noodle they cooked 40mins ago!!! Noodles turned to a solid block and not much sauce left. I couldn't be bothered to talk with these stupid staff. So I just asked for more sauce and tried to eat some of it. I said \"can I have more sauce\" pointing to my noodles. That rude waiter brought a bottle of sauce and I just poured in my noodles and it was soy sauce!! What kind of IQ is required to know I asked sauce for noodle not soy sauce when I'm pointing to noodles??\n",
      "Noodles taste disgusting of course.\n",
      "\n",
      "I couldn't stand that place longer and asked for the bill. And I requested remove service charge. Then the manager came with the menu and tapped the menu on the table saying \" you must pay service charge. It's on the menu\". What horrible and unpleasant people they are. I know very well about this business as working in this industry a long time. Service charge is optional! As they declare it is tip not income. They can't force a customer to pay especially if they fail to provide decent service to me! I told the manager it is optional and you provide horrible service to me then he interrupted while I'm talking about bad service and shouted \" ok! Ok! You just pay meal and go!\" And he tore off the receipt with service charge on in front of me.\n",
      "\n",
      "This place is run by such disgusting ignorant people. None of the staff can speak proper English. The manager is so rude and deceitful. How was food? You can guess from the fact I got noodles they made 40mins ago. If I could, I would want to give minus 5 stars to this place.\n",
      "Beef was off cuts, lamb was mutton, wagu was thin slices of pure fat, no meat, just fat.\n",
      "Service was horrible.\n",
      "Spoke with management about meats quality, I was informed that I can eat anything else.\n",
      "Definetly won't be back, I strongly recomend you stay away from this rip off merchant.\n",
      "If you like to be pushed around and want mediocre food for high prices, then you are in the right place.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should have been warned, because Fisherman's warf is the tourist hell of San Francisco and offers nothing but trash.\n",
      "Nevertheless, I have been guided by the many good ratings, which are completely incomprehensible to me.\n",
      "I arrived on Saturday at 21:10, the restaurant was already empty, but I received the menu. Even when I was ordering, I was told more than clearly that I should order quickly, because the kitchen would close soon. This pressure continued unchanged throughout the evening and increased steadily over the next 45 minutes.\n",
      "This pressure was so high that I can't tell whether the food tasted good or the wine was good. In any case, the prices are out of all proportion to quality. I also know that the waiter wants to get out of work as soon as possible and the whole restaurant is not really a recommendation.\n",
      "Don't go there! This place is horrible, because the people don't like their guests, but only their money.\n",
      "First of all - we went to the Bonchon at 2nd & 51st. What we ordered: Lychee Bellini, Seoul cocktail, Scallion Pancake (Pajeon), Calamari, LaFreida Bulgogi Burger & Fries, Bonchon House Fried Rice w/ Poached Egg, and Medium wings 10 pcs +6 pcs. The Lychee Bellini was like a pink moscato, not a bellini at all. The pajeon came out quite flat, while I was okay with that when I went to pick up a piece I noticed that the bottom was very burned. I asked the server about it and she told me that is how they make it and that all pajeons come out this way. The calamari was very crispy on the outside AND the inside! It just tasted like they deep fried old/dry calamari. Now for the worst part. We went to Bonchon because of the chicken and figured they couldn't screw that up. While the wings were quite tasty the drumsticks were horrible. The drumsticks were gigantic, they must be filled with steroids. They were crispy on the outside but the inside was tasteless. We are NEVER going to another Bonchon again. Wouldn't waste the money.\n",
      "HoneyPig is usually a Korean go to but today we caught the staff at less than stellar. Although not crowded, they were slow with the food and drinks. The check however was served promptly. The meat was okay but very much shredded and in tiny pieces. Not horrible but not their best.\n",
      "We were pretty excited about this place, having recently found Korea-town near our home in Arlington, VA, and also discovering Korean BBQ from food trucks in DC. So, with great giddy anticipation, we opened the doors to Honey Pig only to be met by a wall of the most awful music you ever heard, real thunka-thunka-thunka putridness. There was a longish wait but this gave us a chance to try the odd coffee machine which dispensed the most delicious coffee for only a quarter. We perused the menu and our excitement grew; pork belly a number of ways, bolgogi, steak tar tar, pork neck and so on.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, we eventually sat down. This is one of those places where you cook your own meat on a huge burner right on your table. Anyway, the meat is plopped on and it cooks. There are sides that you can use in what will be a lettuce-wrapped thingy that you build yourself. So, the meat is not seasoned. OK, you enhance flavor with the sides. But the huge pieces of lettuce made not a very good base for this whole operation.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am rambling. What I want to emphasize is that the food is OK, the music is horrible and really really really loud. Do not even think about coming here with children, which we did. There is nothing for them to eat, though my daughter had fun cooking udon noodles on the hot hot hot burner that was inches from her 7 year old fingers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh, and its expensive...\n",
      "I had really horrible experience in Honey Pig. This place has terrible service with terrible food. I can see that people like this place, cuz it opens for 24hrs. However, they have average bbq and side dishes were so unfresh and dried out!!!!!! The servers in this restaurant were very unkind and gave impression to make people to eat fast to turn table as fast they can. I totally recommend other bbq places in Annadale which they have way better service and quality foods!!\n",
      "Not that Chinese can't cook Korean food, it just taste way too horrible. Waste of money. Not authentic and just really not appetising or close to nice. Edible when it's the last restaurant on earth. Service was sad too.\n",
      "I love Korean food, the quality of food was OK. We had the Korean barbecue ribs and Fish along with fried rice. Service is horrible would not recommend this restaurant. You can smell the drain to the toilets very few people were there and it was impossible to get to server to get any additional kimchi, drinks or even replace chopsticks after my colleague has dropped them. It would seem the Chinese staff are not accustomed to the Korean culture. There are a lot better options than this place.\n",
      "I will never consider visiting this place again. The food was horrible. And the service close to hostile.\n",
      "Food is good but customer service is horrible. Really feel not welcoming in the restaurant. Both waiter and waitress are not friendly at all.\n",
      "This is my first time ever writing a review about any restaurant. Had my experience not been this horrible, I would not have written anything about this place. I WARN YOU: DO NOT GO TO THIS RESTAURANT.\n",
      "\n",
      "A little bit about me: I'm Korean, and I have been to several k-bbq restaurants in Korea. I have also been to several k-bbq restaurants in the US. But this place was probably by far the worst out of all of the restaurants that I visited. Not necessarily because of their food, but because their service was simply unacceptable.\n",
      "\n",
      "The interior design was quite nice; however, all of this is misleading, as the food is not that authentic, portions are small, and the service is just rude (even though the restaurant was mostly empty when we were there). We were seated at our table, but the waitress did not come to our table to take our order. She did not even ask us what kind of drinks we would like. She did not take care of our table well. She was unfriendly. She was also pretty bad at grilling the meat. Most importantly, SHE COUNTED THE CASH THAT WE PAID IN FRONT OF US. We were not satisfied with our service, so we did not want to pay the full service charge. We paid 3 pounds out of 5. She stared at us awkwardly, counting the money, until we paid the full service charge!!!! This is simply unacceptable. I have never had any of the waiters/waitresses count money in front of the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't understand why this restaurant has such nice reviews. The food was mediocre at best. We had their kimchi jjigae, which was relatively nice, but the meat was not good at all. The meat was very thin (and very few Korean restaurants in the US or in Korea serve it this way), and I believe the pork belly was frozen meat. Just FYI, cheap bbq restaurants in Korea serve meat this thin in order to make it seem like the meat is not that bad when it's actually just bad quality meat. So this is not the way nice k-bbq should be served.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the amount and quality of the meat that they serve, the food is heavily overpriced. Do not drink any of their Korean liquor. They are also severely overpriced. 15 pounds for soju is not acceptable. It's less than 2 dollars in Korea, it's around 3 dollars in US supermarkets, and around 8 dollars at the restaurants. Lastly, charging for the lettuce and the side dishes is just ridiculous. I have never been to any k-bbq restaurants that severely overcharge you for these side dishes. These dishes should come complimentary with the meal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, just bad. Took some of my friends, and I was embarrassed that I took them there.\n",
      "This was our 3rd time at The Test Kitchen. 6 years ago and 2 years ago, it was always a culinary highlight. So we were looking forward to it again. However, we were more than disappointed this time. It is a pity that since the hype around the restaurant, it is obviously no longer necessary to provide the guest with a good service. The food was certainly good, but the atmosphere and service were horrible. In the dark room we could still enjoy the offered courses. Then we went into the Light Room. As soon as we were seated, the first course came already. We could not even order drinks before. So it was the whole evening. The atmosphere was like in a fast food restaurant. The courses were served in such a fast tempo, which was no a pleasure. In the middle of eating the first course we were then approached by the sommelier from behind. This came so surprisingly so that I swallowed my food. As a result, I could not eat for the next half hour and had to leave the restaurant several times because I had the feeling of suffocating. The service staff did not care about it. Our seats were directly at the kitchen counter and so we could watch the chefs working. What we saw did not make us feel better. So one of the chefs tasted the sauce directly with his finger, which is not very hygienic. Later in the evening, only the courses were served but without any special kindness or attention. To order drinks was totally difficult. The waiters massaged each other's back or were deep in conversation. All waiters chaotically ran back and forth. Every time another waiter came. When we wanted to pay, the restaurant was already almost empty. Unfortunately, we were ignored by the waiters again. They celebrated their own party. Overall, it was a really disappointing experience. Sure the food is still good. But the atmosphere and the service are also important. After our first two visits, we still raved about the food months later. This time we can not remember the food, because the rest was just such a horror and so we could not enjoy the meals. We will certainly not come back. There are too many other very good alternatives in Cape Town, such as the La Colombe.\n",
      "We had a horrible experience here today:\n",
      "\n",
      "- The hostess forgot to write our name down and started seating people who got here after us sooner than us\n",
      "- Waitress recommended an appetizer that they ran out of and then canceled our order for it\n",
      "- Restaurant ran out of a key ingredient for our dinner entree and didn't notify us for 20 mins\n",
      "\n",
      "When we decided to walk out!\n",
      "Had that and the short ribs....outstanding. Good selection of beers, great service!! Bathroom was horrible....yikes! Food was great but this place isn't clean, sad to say..\n",
      "My first visit was extremely promising. My husband and I were the only people there and our food came out super hot and delicious. The beef bulgogi came with the slippery noodles and onions and bean sprout salad. The beef was really soft and not chewy or fatty.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I was really looking forward to my next visit but it was awful. The food was cold to start with, and the beef was unrecognizable from the time before. It was mostly bumpy horrible fat or gristle, not sure as I was not about to eat it. There was also coleslaw on the plate instead of the bean sprout salad, and there were no noodles or onion, just carrots. It was quite busy at the time so perhaps this is one reason the food was awful.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am really sad that I won't be able to eat here again I can't deal with places this inconsistent. The people that work here are super nice. My review would have been 1 star based on the inconsistency of the food.\n",
      "The wait staff treats customers like idiots and crap. Actually there is no customer service at this place. The food is not that good, they over charge you on food and the lack or no service. When walk in the people who work there treat you like you're messing with their day spent standing around doing nothing and not attending to guests already sitting. Even the crap they put on their money is rude. There is no management and these servers keep asking the non-existing managers questions guests have instead of the \"managers\" or \"owners\" coming out and resolving problems that have escalated. DON'T GO TO ANY OF THEIR LOCATIONS. I went to their Northglenn location and received horrible service so you can imagine how bad Aurora would be.\n",
      "We were so excited to see a Korean joint in the neighbourhood... wow we’re we disappointed. The decor was ok, but the atmosphere felt like a fancy take out restaurant (which it might very well be).\n",
      "\n",
      "We ordered the chicken and kimchi dumplings (which sounds amazing), the beef bibimbop and the Korean chilli chicken wings. The dumplings were flavourless and served with a drop of mayonnaise (). The bibimbop was almost cold - certainly not sizzling. The rice had no crisp to it and everything was under seasoned (if seasoned AT ALL). The $15 bibimbop was also served with a “miso soup”...it was powdered salt with water and green onion. If you are going to serve miso soup like that, just don’t. Lastly, the chicken wings... you would think a Korean restaurant would know how to deep fry chicken... nope. They were nearly raw and the sauce they used was horrible. Again, zero crisp.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, we’re choked that we forked out $50 dollars on food that should have been $30. Had it been priced accordingly, I wouldn’t be writing this review.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don’t waste your money.\n",
      "Worst service ever by a korean buffet, the manager make faces when we ask for something... how would you expect the staff to be customer friendly if the manager himself is rude... it will take years before they will respond to your requests... probably they are friendly only to the koreans... worst CR too, it smells horrible... definitely will not come back\n",
      "This was probably my worst Korean restaurant experience. The service was absolutely horrendous, the food was super dry and over cooked.\n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered a plate of bulgogi with rice, and the beef looked, and tasted like it had been sitting on the pan for a few hours, waiting for a customer.\n",
      "\n",
      "My son's teriaki salmon was overcooked and super dry; my wife's naeng myung tasted horrible.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are so many other Korean restaurants in the area, I would recommend going there first before here. I think the only appealing thing about this place is that it's open super late, so if you're drunk, coming home from the club, and don't really care for the food quality & just want something moderately cheap, then this is the place for you.\n",
      "So it's McDonalds...you'd think you'd know what to expect right? Kinda....\n",
      "\n",
      "Almost nothing else in the streets of Songtan besides McDonald's is open before 11am. They had some weird chicken and cheese sandwich my boyfriend ordered for breakfast and that looked and [he said] also tasted horrible! However we both had the breakfast hash browns and those were waaaaay better than stateside because they weren't as greasy and cooked almost perfectly (I mean when aren't they good though right lol come on?!?). My bacon, egg, and cheese breakfast sandwich was just as I expected. Do not upgrade a breakfast meal to Orange juice...it's not out of the machine like in the states, rather a pre-packaged juice drink type deal really really small and not at all worth it!\n",
      "\n",
      "Other than that I've only had a strawberry sundae here...kinda hard to screw up ice cream! Price is obviously super reasonable! It was kinda frustrating to wait in line at the regular counter only to figure out you could only order ice cream type stuff from the front counter with the walk up outside window.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, this McDonald's offers delivery via motor scooter....kinda cool huh....never seen a Mickey D's offer that without using an outsourced delivery company!\n",
      "Extremely extremely rude staff! Didn’t even have a chance to order food before the waiter showed his horrible attitude. Would not eat food at this establishment with such rude wait staff!\n",
      "If you are looking for a good place to eat, do not come here. Terrible place, horrible service, the brew is rude and the manager does not know how to port. Funny that they have a \"Michelin\" sticker on the door, they may just have been bought! Worst experience ever! I do not recommend! Do not be disappointed!\n",
      "We heard nice things about their Jjam Bbong 짬뽕 (spicy seafood noodle soup) and Chimeg 치맥 (fried chicken wings with beer) so went to try them at lunch time. We waited more than 30 minutes for the food (at lunch time!) and it was the worst Jjam Bbong we've had in London. The soup was luke warm and the noodles were terrible. After tasting it, we decided not to eat it (we know how it should taste as we regular have it in Korean restaurants in London and New Malden, and of course in Korea). Fried chichen wings were cold and tasteless. Overall, much worse than the quality of food at Wsgamama or Itsu. Only the beer tasted alright.\n",
      "\n",
      "The interior was nice but the services were horrible. It is rare to see all of the waiters and waittesses being so unprofessional and unfriendly. It took too long for food to be served. They still wanted to add service charge and we had to complain and told them to remove the service charge.\n",
      "Probably the worst meal I ever ate in an restaurant. It was so horrid that I still feel sick when I think about it.\n",
      "Was so horrible that I created a membership to write a review.\n",
      "I was visiting some friends in the posh offices around, it was Friday evening and I haven't had lunch, I saw the restaurant, checked out the menu outside and decide to treat myself for a nice warm dinner. Since the area is so posh and the restaurant looked favourable, as it was almost full, I assumed it would worth a visit. As I was alone, I got a place at the 'kids corner' and got service from at least four different staff members. I ordered a Negroni, a glass of tap water, sea weed salad and Jajang Myeon \"Pork cooked in a black bean and sesame sauce, served in a bed of noodles\" as a main.\n",
      "I got served my main only maybe 2 minutes after I ordered, which I found quite suspicious in a crowded restaurant as it means they had everything pre-cooked and probably just microwaved it before serving. I didn't care about much as I was hungry and it wasn't super expensive.\n",
      "I was quite disappointed as I got my cocktail after the main, since I ordered as an aperitiv as one would say. Each item was served by a different member of staff, water the last. Staff seemed confused, which I think is normal, but were friendly.\n",
      "As there was no way I could drink up my cocktail before the meal, I decided to dig in. I am not particularly keen on onions so my first step of 'digging in' is picking the onions, at least the bigger pieces and putting them aside and chopsticks are particularly handy for this trick. I started picking the onions one after another.The problem was that I could not reach any other ingredients no matter how resilient in digging. After a while, I was convinced that they might have forgotten the other ingredients as the restaurant was busy and I got my main maybe 2-3 minutes tops after I ordered.\n",
      "I decided to ask a staff member if this really was what I ordered. I rarely complain about food especially in crowded places, because usually the restaurant policy is to change the dish or to ask if I wanted to order something else and that means I have to wait. This was the reaction I thought I was going to get or that they would apologise for the the forgotten ingredients.\n",
      "But no! The staff member stared at my food for a while and said that the dish was really what I ordered, Then I asked about the possibility of the chef forgetting the ingredients. He stared a little more. and decided to point out one piece of onion in the pile and said:\"This is pork, but finely cut so you cannot tell\". I thanked him and decided to try the rectangular piece. Of course it was yet another piece of onion as all the rest!\n",
      "In my struggle, I managed to dig out one tine piece of pork (not rectangular) and two pieces on mushrooms (this was a surprise as they were not mentioned in the menu although they seemed to be the main ingredient).\n",
      "After the surprising reaction that I got, I decided not to ruin my mood, drink my cocktail and eat the bits that I could dig out. What I could dig out was simply the awful overcooked ramen under the onion pile.\n",
      "I accidentally ate some of the onions and I also experimented with the rectangular pieces to find something edible, but I attached the picture of the remaining pile. Well, photos don't have depth so it might not seem as big, but still you can get the main idea.\n",
      "Long story short, the cocktail and the salad were nice.\n",
      "Regarding the optional questions: The toilets are located downstairs and you have to climb up and down a lot of steep stairs. There were four toilets, one of which was locked, the other one was dirty as it didn't flush and the third one did not have a seat. All the customers at that busy hour had to share a single toilet.\n",
      "Anyway, maybe it was just a coincidence but when I was leaving I tried to glimpse at the other customers' plates, but what I saw did not impress me.\n",
      "Maybe it was just a coincidence or maybe I was just unlucky, but I have no desire to visit this restaurant again.\n",
      "I gave this restaurant the benefit of the doubt as my friends have advised me that the restaurant has improved alot since my last visit and oh boy did i wish that I hadn't given it a second go. Service was so slow and to be honest I think they were lacking alot of staff. We waited 10minutes for a table would in my opinion could have been given quicker if they were bothered to reset tables (which they werent). Moving on, we were sat in the corner right next to the open door and it was a breezy Monday night. Menu wasn't exciting and was quite boring. Took ages for a server to come. The ordering went well aside from the fact that it's just restaurant 101 to give drinks menu along with the food menu. This was not given so it took another 5mins for us to decide. I went for the Green Breeze and honest to god I wish I hadn't. The combination of all the ingredients was just horrible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next the food did arrive very speedily which was good but that's where all the compliments start and stop. The only downside was all the food came all at once (starters and mains). There was one problem with this is that the table they have placed us on was one of the smallest table in the whole place. The smart thing to do was have the food come out slowly so that we all could have some space but common sense isnt very common.\n",
      "\n",
      "The thing that concerned me the most was that if the food all came out at once very fast was either the chefs were super speedy like sonic the hedgehog or majority of theç food was pre cooked and kept in hot holding. Coming from hospitality background I believe it was the latter.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had ordered the 200g Rib eye Steak, and on the menu it had stated it would be cooked the way you want it. I don't remember asking for a tasteless rare steak. Heck I don't eve remember being asked how I wanted it cook. The steak was seriously lacking dire need of some salt and pepper. Was very chewy. I think I would have enjoyed chewing the bottom of my shoe better seeing as I would get more flavour out of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Being called Kim Chee I would expect that your side order of kimchi would be more tasteful or something special. Tasted like it came out of a ready made packet you get from Koreatown.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall the meal was a shambles and i had wished I spent my money elsewhere. My girlfriend had to down the 1L of rice wine just to forget how awful the meal was.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bill came to £80. I has basically paid for disappointment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Save your money and go elsewhere\n",
      "The decor is great but the food was horrible. I had the stir fried seafood, there were 3 prawns, 3 mussels, the same of squid. It was in an awful gloopy sauce. There was much on the menu that sounded appealing. Wouldn’t try go again.\n",
      "My girlfriend and I go went for St Valentine date to Kimchee and it was horrible.\n",
      "There was only a special st Valentine menu which had only a choice of 4 dishes, which were very bad.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rice was without any sauce, you would give that kind of rice to a dog. My girlfriend asked for a sauce, and they brought to her one super spicy one, and she almost fainted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, we were disappointed because it wasn't the first time for us going there, and usually the normal menu is okay.\n",
      "For St Valentine day they had this super limited and bad menu, which was overpriced (£30). We usually go there and we eat with £15-20. (without wine, as we don't drink).\n",
      "\n",
      "We will NEVER go back again to this place. The MOST annoying thing is that they tried to RIP customers OFF just because it was st Valentine Day.\n",
      "So annoyed, and happy to see that the restaurant was almost empty (on a day when every restaurant was fully booked).\n",
      "\n",
      "TO THE MANAGEMENT; trying to RIP customers OFF, you have lost a lot of money!\n",
      "Sadly the other reviews for this restaurant proved to be correct; whilst the food was acceptable the staff seemed in a constant panic despite there not being many tables and plenty of staff on. The staff weren't unfriendly or impolite, just extremely forgetful and seemingly confused about how their business was run. We were left unattended for extended periods of time, and some of our orders simply did not turn up (or only partially turned up). We tried to communicate this but the waiter didn't seem able to understand out concerns (he wasn't rude but had a south-american accent and didn't seem confident in English) so gave up eventually.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing horrible happened on our visit, but there's clearly some failing at management or ownership level that aren't training the staff properly or maintaining service standards.\n",
      "The first time we were in the family cafe Bulgogi which did not have an alcohol licence. The dishes were very tasty, and a bottle of wine which we brought perfectly complemented the food.\n",
      "\n",
      "This time we visited this restaurant at the new location in the town centre. We chose this place to celebrate a special occasion. This time the food was as tasty as before, but the wine was absolutely horrible. At home we looked online at the wine and the same bottle was being sold for £1.99 at tesco. We recommend that you get tea or beer.\n",
      "Just back from Bulgogi. The good points: close to car park, realtively friendly staff, the food we had was good but not amazing.\n",
      "The negatives: very bright light, draughty airconditioning, horrible music, small portions. We wanted to order the menu based on an earlier recommendation but none of the mains that came with it was \"grill on your table\" and we went there for this experience. We weren't really given good advice. When asking how best to put a balanced meal together the waitress was constantly looking over her shoulder as if waiting to be told of for spending time with our order. Also when we were still eating our starters, the main already arrived. It felt very rushed. We ordered dessert but others got their free melon plunked in front of them as soon as they finished chewing their main courses.\n",
      "Will not go back!\n",
      "We used to frequent Thai Thai a lot when we first moved here but interacting with the staff has forced us to mark it off of our list. We enjoyed the Americanized type of Thai they have there but it is not worth it and I do not want to give them any more of my money. There is an Asian place in Einsidlerhof that has much better Thai than this restaurant. The take out packaging is horrible as well, almost every time it leaks or is busted no matter how well we take care of it on the ride home.\n"
